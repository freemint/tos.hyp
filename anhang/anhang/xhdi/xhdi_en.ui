!begin_node XHDI - eXtended HardDisk Interface (Version 1.30)
!label XHDI

The purpose of the (!nolink [XHDI]) (`e(!B)X(!b)tended (!B)H(!b)ard(!B)D(!b)isk (!B)I(!b)nterface') specification
is to enhance the communication with drivers for block-oriented mass
storage media. We started with the thought of creating a uniform
interface for some additional driver features. One goal was to create
a standard method for virtual memory systems to lock the eject button
of Syquest hard disk drives (you don't want the user to remove the
cartridge with the swap partition).

After further discussion, it was clear that the information available
via the PUN_INFO structure just wasn't enough and that the missing
information should be available with the help of this (!nolink [XHDI])
specification. Reasons:

!begin_itemize
!item The PUN_INFO structure only has room for 16 devices, but (!nolink [BIOS])
     (and some (!nolink [GEMDOS]) replacements) allow 32 devices
!item It is impossible to install more than one AHDI-compatible
     hard disk driver in the system (there is only one (!nolink [PUN_INFO])
     structure)

!item Atari's definition of device numbers only works for drives with
     Logical Unit Number 0
!end_itemize

(!B)For these reasons, the purpose of the (!nolink [XHDI]) specification is:(!b)

!begin_itemize
!item To provide more information about the (!nolink [installed]) devices
!item To support new driver features like Stop/Start or Lock/Unlock
!end_itemize

The (!nolink [XHDI]) specification doesn't define new driver features - it should
be easy to retrofit it into existing drivers.

!begin_node XHDI cookie

Cookie ID: '(!nolink [XHDI])'. The contents of the cookie points to the start
address of a function which provides procedures for dealing with
block storage devices. As an additional check, the function is
preceded by the LONG constant 0x27011992.

The contents of the (!nolink [XHDI]) cookie may change (because it can be used by
more than one driver). Therefore, in some applications (example: Desk
accessories) the cookie contents must be inquired each time before the
handler is called.

(!B)How to install more than one (!nolink [XHDI]) driver:(!b)

!begin_xlist [(1)]
!item [(1)]
During the installation, check whether the cookie is already set. If so:

!item [(2)]
For XHGetVersion first jump through the old vector and return
the minimum of this and your own version number.

!item [(3)]
For XHDrvMap first jump through the old vector and then OR in
the drive bits for the devices supported by you.

!item [(4)]
For all other functions: Check whether it is one of your
devices. If not, jump through the old vector.

!begin_node Arbitration

For device drivers which support SCSI arbitration, the machine needs
an own SCSI device number which must be unique and shouldn't be stored
on disk. Atari has reserved byte 16 in the non-volatile memory (NVRAM)
of the Atari TT030 and Falcon030 computers. Bit assignments:

!begin_xlist !short [Bit 0..2:]
!item [Bit 0..2:]
Device number
!item [Bit 7:]
Arbitration on (1) or off (0)
!end_xlist

(!B)The current arbitration number could be inquired this way:(!b)

!begin_verbatim
WORD arbitration_id (VOID)
{
   LONG ret = EINVFN;
   UBYTE nvmdata = 0;
   OSHEADER *Sys;
   LONG oldstack = Super(0L);
   Sys = *_sysbase;
   Super((VOID *)oldstack);

   host_id = -1;   /* no arbitration by default */

   if (Sys->os_version >= 0x300)
      ret = NVMaccess (0, 16, (WORD) sizeof (nvmdata), &nvmdata);

   if (ret == E_OK && (nvmdata & 0x80))
      host_id = nvmdata & 7;

   return host_id;

!begin_node Partition type RAW

(!nolink [XHDI])-1.10 compliant drivers shall support the third partition type RAW
(in addition to (!nolink [GEM]) and BGM). For these partitions, the following
should be true:


!begin_xlist [(1)]
!item [(1)]
The partition size is `arbitrary' (32-bit sector numbers).
!item [(2)]
The partition can be accessed as a (!nolink [BIOS]) device; Getbpb returns a
      NULL pointer (so that (!nolink [GEMDOS]) won't access it; however, calling
      Getbpb resets the driver internal media change state).

!item [(3)]
Rwabs (in physical or logical mode) and XHReadWrite may be
      used to access the partition. The physical block size of the
      medium is used (see XHInqTarget).

!item [(4)]
XHInqDev2 (as compared to XHInqDev) returns size and type of the partition.

!end_xlist

These extensions have been made to make it easier to create drivers
for new filesystems for MiNT or MagiC (like the Minix filesystem).

!begin_node XHDI functions

All functions have to be called from supervisor-mode. The effects of a
call in user-mode are undefined. All processor registers except d0 are
preserved. (!nolink [EINVFN]) is returned for invalid opcodes.

Some of the function calls - notably `XHReadWrite' - might be
implemented by calls to (!nolink [BIOS]) or (!nolink [XBIOS]) functions and therefore can
activate the `Critical Error Handler'. It's the responsibility of the
caller to switch of the `CEH', if this is needed.

!label XHDI error-codes
The following return values are defined for all functions:

(!B)(!nolink [TOS]) error-codes:(!b)

!begin_table [r l]
  0: !! OK (OK)
 -1: !! Unspecified (!nolink [error]) ((!nolink [ERROR]))
 -2: !! Device not responding ((!nolink [EDRVNR]))
-15: !! Unknown device ((!nolink [EUNDEV]))
-32: !! Invalid function number ((!nolink [EINVFN]))
-36: !! Access denied, device is reserved ((!nolink [EACCDN]))
-46: !! Invalid drive number ((!nolink [EDRIVE]))
!end_table

(!B)SCSI error-codes (ranging from -200 to -455)(!b)

!begin_xlist [(-200 - N):]
!item [(-200 - N):]
SCSI error-code N (the `Additional Sense Code', byte 12
              in the `Extended Sense Format', see (!nolink [Appendix]) B in `Draft
              proposed American National Standard for information
              systems - Revision 11a - SCSI-3 Primary Commands, 28
              March 1997)
!end_xlist

(!B)IDE error-codes (ranging from -456 to -711)(!b)

!begin_xlist [(-456 - N):]
!item [(-456 - N):]
IDE error-code N (value of the IDE error register)
!end_xlist

(!B)Note:(!b) Obviously, you can get SCSI error-codes only for ACSI or SCSI
devices. For other device types like IDE drives the following
assignments may be used:

!begin_table [l l l l]
Bit in IDE- !! ~ !! ~ !! ~
(!nolink [error]) register !! Meaning !! SCSI error !! (!nolink [XHDI]) error
!hline
1 !! Track 0 not found      !! $06 !! -206
0 !! DAM not found          !! $13 !! -219
4 !! ID-Field not found     !! $12 !! -218
7 !! Bad block mark         !! $10 !! -216
6 !! Uncorrectable (!nolink [error])    !! $11 !! -217
2 !! Command aborted        !! $20 !! -232
5 !! Media Change           !! $28 !! -240
3 !! Media Change requested !! $5A !! -290
!end_table

(It is recommended to test the bits in the above order).

For other devices (like disk drives connected to the floppy
controller) there may be other, not yet defined, error-codes.

Parameters are passed the same way as to (!nolink [GEMDOS]) functions. All values
are put onto the stack, with the 16-bit opcode last, i.e. at the
lowest address. The 32-bit result is returned in d0.

Wherever it is specified that `the caller may pass a zero pointer' for
a pointer parameter, then passing such a zero pointer indicates that
the caller is not interested in the value to be returned. Drivers must
always check pointers for zero before dereferencing them.

!begin_node XHDOSLimits

(!begin_liste) [Return Value]

!item [Name:]
¯XHDOSLimits® - Set/get internal limits of DOS.

!item [Opcode:]
17

!item [Syntax:]
LONG XHDOSLimits ( UWORD which, ULONG limit );

!item [Description:]
The function XHDOSLimits asks the driver for the
internal limits of the currently running DOS (or sets
the driver's limits). (!B)Example:(!b) it can be used by a FAT
filesystem driver to inform the driver about the change
of some of the limits. (!I)which(!i) describes the type of
limit, (!I)limit(!i) is the new value (with zero meaning that
the value shouldn't be changed). The function returns
the previous value for the limit.

As a required functionality starting with (!nolink [XHDI])
release 1.30 a driver shall retrieve limit values from
previously started (!nolink [XHDI]) drivers, if these exist. When
a limit is changed, this information then shall be
passed through to other (!nolink [XHDI]) drivers.

The (!nolink [BPB]) is invalid if the structure element (!I)recsiz(!i) is zero.

If the partition ID isn't available (possible reason:
no standard Atari root sector or no root sector at
all), an empty string is returned.
