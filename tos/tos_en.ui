!begin_node The Operating System TOS

The operating system (!nolink [TOS]) ((!B)T(!b)he (!B)O(!b)perating (!B)S(!b)ystem)
may be subdivided into
various sections. Communications with the users is realized via GEM,
which offers a comfortable user-interface and is composed of AES- and
VDI-functions.

Beyond this many further routines are available, which may be
allocated to one of the following categories:

!begin_itemize !short
!item (!link [GEMDOS][About the GEMDOS])
!item (!link [BIOS][About the BIOS])
!item (!link [XBIOS][About the XBIOS])
!end_itemize

(!nolink [TOS]) dates back to the year 1985. In the course of time it was further
developed by Atari and is available for various models of computer
(ST, STE, Mega-ST, TT, Falcon, ...). In addition there are a number
of (!nolink [TOS])-compatible systems offered by third parties. Worth mentioning
in this connection are, above all, MagiC and Geneva. While MagiC has
become important particularly in Germany (and the U.K.), Geneva seems
to have met with a certain amount of approval in the USA. Thanks to
MagiC Mac, an implementation of MagiC to the Apple (Power) Macintosh
hardware, (!nolink [TOS]) programs are now running also on Apple computers.
A later variant, MagiC PC, has also extended this to many Windows
machines.

!begin_node GEM
GEM ((!B)G(!b)raphics (!B)E(!b)nvironment (!B)M(!b)anager) is a part of the operating system 
that represents the (graphical) interface between the computer and 
the user. GEM was developed by the firm (!I)Digital Research(!i) in 1984 for 
PCs with Intel processors. The system became well-known, however, 
mainly when the Atari ST was marketed, offering a powerful and well-
priced alternative to the (at the time) expensive PC and Macintosh
machines.

In the course of time, GEM was adapted to various operating systems 
and hardware platforms, including:

!begin_itemize !short
!item PC GEM
!item Atari GEM
!item GEM on X (version for Unix systems)
!item X/GEM, for FlexOS operation system
!end_itemize

GEM may be divided into two sub-areas:

!begin_itemize !short
!item (!link [AES][About the AES]), Application Environment (!nolink [Services])
!item (!link [VDI][About the VDI]), Virtual Device Interface
!end_itemize

The (!nolink [AES]) takes charge of organising the user environment, whereas the 
(!nolink [VDI]) looks after a uniform graphical rendition of the user interface. 
During development of GEM programs it is imperative to keep to the 
valid (!link [style guidelines][Style guidelines]) and never attempt to force on the user one's 
own interface 'surface' that doesn't keep to any standards.


!begin_node The various GEM versions

For the GEM version number one normally uses the ID returned in the
global field by the appl_init call. The (!link [VDI][About the VDI]), on the other hand, has
actually (!I)no(!i) version number of its own, the more so as the behaviour
of the individual (!link [VDI][About the VDI])-functions is determined principally by the
device drivers used which are, after all, replacable.

(!B)One can differentiate roughly between the following GEM-versions:(!b)

!label GEM-Version 1.x
(!B)(!nolink [GEM]) 1.x:(!b) This first AES version (1.x) had, not accidently, very
great similarities with the operating system of the Apple Macintosh.
This manifested itself not only in the design of the window elements,
but also in many features of the desktop and other application
programs. At the time, (!nolink [GEM]) was exhibited mostly in connection with
test versions of (!I)GEM-Draw, (!nolink [GEM])-Paint(!i) and (!I)GEM-Write(!i), which
corresponded in many details with the known Macintosh prototypes
MacDraw, MacPaint and MacWrite.

This is also the version that was finally adopted by Atari and
delivered in the ST; all newer versions of Atari-(!nolink [GEM]) are also based
on this version. This is because the Atari company then acquired
all the rights for the existing version, and itself continued to
develop it. This also explains the ever-yawning differences between
PC-(!nolink [GEM]) and Atari-GEM. The greatest defect of the Atari version was
surely the absence of the Graphics Device Operating Systems (GDOS);
this contains device-independent graphical functions, which were
implemented on the Atari only for the screen, and so had to be post-
loaded separately for printers, plotters, cameras etc. As a result
(particularly in the early days of the Atari), each program used
their own drivers and formats, so that data exchange between
applications became almost impossible.


!label GEM-Version 2.x
(!B)(!nolink [GEM]) 2.x:(!b)
Due to a legal dispute between Apple and Digital Research
(which mainly concerned the look of application programs and the
desktop), the (!I)PC-version(!i) of the GEM had to be altered.

The settlement, which did not affect Atari's (!nolink [GEM])-version, looked
like this:

!begin_itemize !short
!item Some window elements were altered in such a way that they no
      longer looked like the Macintosh windows (above all the title
      bar)

!item The Accessory menu wandered into the opposite (right) corner
     of the screen

!item The functions graf_growbox and graf_shrinkbox were eliminated

!item The desktop was reprogrammed completely, and tied down to two
     fixed windows. Contrary to customary views, however, this was
     only a change in the desktop, and (!I)not(!i) in the AES, which
     continued to permit up to eight overlapping windows.
!end_itemize

However there were not just restrictions, but also improvements.
The most important example one should mention is that accessories
could install their own menu bar.

This version received the version number 2.0 and was supplied from
1987 onwards; only a little later it was ported by the Dutch software
house ABC together with (!I)(!nolink [GEM])-Draw, GEM-Paint, GEM-Graph(!i) and of course
the (!I)(!nolink [GEM]) desktop(!i) to the Atari. However this version never attained
much importance, unfortunately, and is today (!I)no longer available.(!i)

!label GEM-Version 3.x, PC-
(!B)PC-(!nolink [GEM]) 3.x:(!b)
This version contained some minor improvements. Thus
the menu behaviour can be switched from drop-down to pull-down, for
instance.

From (!nolink [GEM])/3 version 3.11 on further VDI-functions exist, which are
concerned with Bezier functions and Postscript printers. The program
ARTLINE makes use of these new functions with its vector fonts.

Due to the dominance of MS-Windows this version has practically
vanished from the PC market.

(!nolink [GEM]) Desktop 3.13 :
The last standard retail version shipped. Part of
the (!nolink [GEM]) PTK/SDK 3.13 which finally was rewritten to support ANSI C
compilers.

!begin_verbatim
GEM/4  DRIVDI.EXE     Only made it to the market as runtime support
       DRIAES.EXE     for Artline/2, PresTeam/2, Publish it/3 etc.
                      The VDI will use EMS, if available.
                      The GEM/3 desktop will not run properly, and
                      a com shell provided to launch gem/4 apps from
                      the GEM/3 desktop may crash after repeated use.

                      Probably the model for DRI's X/GEM for FlexOS,
                      A 32bit protected mode multitasking system.
!end_verbatim

!label ViewMax
ViewMax/ DR-DOS 5.0: A 'crippled' (!nolink [GEM])/4 kernel, can only be used as
a shell to call (!nolink [GEM]) Applications. Although designed for DR DOS, it will
run under MS-DOS 3.x and later (minus passwords). To use it with GEM apps you
must have a GEM/3 installation as well as a Viewmax installation.
This version was written in Lattice C 3.x

ViewMax/ DR-DOS 6.0:  Improved version of the above, but with the
same kernel limitations as the above.
This version was rewritten in Turbo C2.0 and
and allows configuration via *.ini file.



!label Extended GEM
!label GEM, Extended
!label X/GEM
(!B)X/(!nolink [GEM]):(!b)
This GEM version was developed by (!I)Digital Research(!i) on a
multi-user multitasking operating system (FlexOS), and permits the
simultaneous handling of several applications in the foreground.

!label GEM-Version 1.4, Atari-
(!B)Atari-(!nolink [GEM]) 1.4:(!b)
Major changes were made by Atari only in GEM 1.4 of
(!nolink [TOS]) 1.04; best known feature is the greatly improved file selector.

Wichtige Žnderungen hat Atari erst im GEM 1.4
des TOS 1.04 vorgenommen; bekannteste Auswirkung ist der stark verbesserte
Fileselektor.

!label GEM-Version 3.x, Atari-
(!B)Atari-(!nolink [GEM]) 3.x:(!b) (!I)Not yet written.(!i)

!label GEM-Version 4.x, Atari-
(!B)Atari-(!nolink [GEM]) 4.x:(!b) (!I)Not yet written.(!i)
