(!begin_liste) [Availability]

!item [Name:]
ØFcntlÆ - Perform command operations on a given file.

!item [Opcode:]
260

!item [Syntax:]
int32_t Fcntl ( int16_t fh, int32_t arg, int16_t cmd );

!item [Description:]
The function performs various command operations on the file with the handle
(!I)fh(!i). The parameter (!I)cmd(!i) describes the desired operation, and
can assume the following values. ((!I)arg(!i) here depends on the selected
command):

!label Fcntl, File commands for
!label F_DUPFD
(!B)F_DUPFD (0):(!b)
(!nl)
Duplicates the specified file handle. The following applies for the new
interval: (!I)arg(!i) <= Handle < 32. If no free handles exist in the
specified segment, the error-message ENHNDL will be returned. A call of Fdup
(handle) is therefore equivalent to Fcntl (handle, 6L, F_DUPFD).

!label F_GETFD
(!B)F_GETFD (1):(!b)
(!nl)
This command returns the non-inheritance flag for the handle (!I)fh(!i). The
flag is 0 when child processes started with Pexec are to inherit the file
handle, otherwise it has the value 1 and the parameter (!I)arg(!i) is
ignored.

!label F_SETFD
(!B)F_SETFD (2):(!b)
(!nl)
This command sets the non-inheritance flag for the handle (!I)fh(!i).
(!I)arg(!i) specifies if child processes started with Pexec will inherit the
file handle; a value of 1 indicates they will not, a value of 0 that they
will. The default value for the flag is 0 for the standard GEMDOS handles in
the region 0...5 and 1 for all others, i.e. non-standard handles.

!label F_GETFL
(!B)F_GETFL (3):(!b)
(!nl)
This command returns the file descriptor flags that can be altered by the
user. We are here dealing with  the parameter (!I)mode(!i) specified at
Fopen, as long as this has not been altered by another call of Fcntl.
(!I)arg(!i) is ignored.

!label F_SETFL
(!B)F_SETFL (4):(!b)
(!nl)
This command sets the file descriptor flags that can be altered by the user
to (!I)arg(!i) (the other bits are ignored, and should be set to the value
0). It is not possible to alter the read/write mode or the modes for file
sharing.

!label F_GETLK
(!B)F_GETLK (5):(!b)
(!nl)
The parameter (!I)arg(!i) is a pointer to an
(!link [flock structure][flock, Fcntl]), in which information about file
locks are stored. If a lock exists then it will be copied into the
structure. During this the element (!I)l_pid(!i) will hold the PID of the
locking process. If no lock exists, then the element (!I)l_type(!i) will be
set to the value F_UNLCK. For the case that the lock is held by another
computer in a network, the element (!I)l_pid(!i) is set to a value defined
by the NFS ((!B)N(!b)etwork (!B)F(!b)ile (!B)S(!b)ystem). For this value,
0x1000 <= (!I)l_pid(!i) <= 0xffff. One should note that normal PID's have a
value smaller than 1000.

!label F_SETLK
(!B)F_SETLK (6):(!b)
(!nl)
This command sets ((!I)l_type(!i) = F_RDLCK or F_WRLCK) or lifts
((!I)l_type(!i) = F_UNLCK) an advisory lock on the specified file. If this
is a  FIFO queue ((!B)F(!b)irst-(!B)I(!b)n-(!B)F(!b)irst-(!B)O(!b)ut), the
whole file must be processed at the same time. For the case when the lock
conflicts with locks set by other processes, the value ELOCKED will be
returned. If one tries to lift a non-existent lock, the value ENSLOCK will
be returned. One should note that read-locks may overlap, but write-locks
may not. If a locked file is closed, or the corresponding process
terminates, then all set locks will be lifted automatically (i.e. reset).

!label F_SETLKW
(!B)F_SETLKW (7):(!b)
(!nl)
Similar to F_SETLK, with the difference that if the lock conflicts with
those from other processes, then ELOCKED is not returned but the locked
process is suspended until the locking from the other process is lifted.

!label FSTAT
(!B)FSTAT (0x4600):(!b)
(!nl)
Gets the extended attributes of a file. The parameter (!I)arg(!i) returns a
pointer to an XATTR structure that is filled in with the file's extended
attributes, as if an Fxattr call had been made. This command is supported in
MagiC as of Version 3.0.

!label FIONREAD
(!B)FIONREAD (0x4601):(!b)
(!nl)
In the parameter (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to a LONG value is returned which
shows the number of bytes that may be read currently from a specified file
handle without causing the process to block (wait for more input). The
returned value is not necessarily correct, as the exact amount can only be
estimated in some cases. The command is supported in MagiC as of Version
3.0.

!label FIONWRITE
(!B)FIONWRITE (0x4602):(!b)
(!nl)
Similar to FIONREAD, only here the number of bytes that may be written at
present is returned. The command is supported in MagiC as of Version 3.0.

!label FUTIME
(!B)FUTIME (0x4603):(!b)
(!nl)
No information available at present.

!label FTRUNCATE
(!B)FTRUNCATE (0x4604):(!b)
(!nl)
The parameter (!I)arg(!i) is a pointer to a LONG value that contains the new
length of the file to be truncated. The command is supported in MagiC as of
Version 3.0.

!label FIOEXECPT
(!B)FIOEXECPT (0x4605):(!b)
(!nl)
In the parameter (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to a LONG value is returned which
specifies whether the file is in an exception state (1) or not (0).

!label Fcntl, Terminal commands for
(!B)The following commands are to be applied to all terminal devices such as
the console or a pseudo-terminal:(!b)

!label TIOCGETP
(!B)TIOCGETP (0x5400):(!b)
(!nl)
This command returns via the parameter (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to a sgttyb
structure, in which the parameters of the terminal are defined.

!label TIOCSETN
(!B)TIOCSETN (0x5401):(!b)
(!nl)
With this command one can set a new sgttyb structure which sets the
parameters of the terminal. You should first get the terminal
(!nolink [control]) parameters, modify what you wish to change, and then set
them with this call.

!label TIOCGETC
(!B)TIOCGETC (0x5402):(!b)
(!nl)
This command returns via the parameter (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to a tchars
structure in which the terminal (!nolink [control]) characters are defined.

!label TIOCSETC
(!B)TIOCSETC (0x5403):(!b)
(!nl)
With this command new terminal (!nolink [control]) characters can be set.
For this one passes a pointer in (!I)arg(!i) to a tchars structure in which
the (!nolink [control]) characters are defined. If a character is set to 0
then the corresponding function will be disabled.

!label TIOCGLTC
(!B)TIOCGLTC (0x5404):(!b)
(!nl)
This command returns via the parameter (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to a ltchars
structure in which extended terminal (!nolink [control]) characters are
defined.

!label TIOCSLTC
(!B)TIOCSLTC (0x5405):(!b)
(!nl)
With this command one can set new extended terminal (!nolink [control])
characters. To do this, one passes in (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to a ltchars
structure in which the (!nolink [control]) characters are defined. If a
character is set to 0 then the corresponding function will be disabled.

!label TIOCGPGRP
(!B)TIOCGPGRP (0x5406):(!b)
(!nl)
This command returns via the parameter (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to the process
group ID of the terminal.

!label TIOCSPGRP
(!B)TIOCSPGRP (0x5407):(!b)
(!nl)
With this command one can set the process group ID of the terminal. To do
this, one passes in the parameter (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to the corresponding
process group. If processes from other groups should attempt to access this
terminal (read or write) then they will be sent job (!nolink [control])
signals (SIGTSTP etc.).

!label TIOCFLUSH
(!B)TIOCFLUSH (0x5408):(!b)
(!nl)
With this command one can specify the type of flushing. For this, one passes
a pointer in the parameter (!I)arg(!i) to a LONG value that describes the
desired type. The following apply:

!begin_xlist !short [Bit 1 set]
!item [Value]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [0]
Flush input and output
!item [Bit 0 set]
Flush input
!item [Bit 1 set]
Flush output
!end_xlist

!label TIOCSTOP
(!B)TIOCSTOP (0x5409):(!b)
(!nl)
This command interrupts the output to the terminal (similar to flow
(!nolink [control]) with Control-S). The parameter (!I)arg(!i) is ignored in
this case.

!label TIOCSTART
(!B)TIOCSTART (0x540a):(!b)
(!nl)
This command restarts output to the terminal again (similar to flow
(!nolink [control]) with Control-Q). The parameter (!I)arg(!i) is ignored in
this case.

!label TIOCGWINSZ
(!B)TIOCGWINSZ (0x540b):(!b)
(!nl)
With this command one can inquire the size of a text window. For this a
pointer to a winsize structure is returned via the parameter (!I)arg(!i). If
an element of this structure has the value 0, then it means that the
corresponding value is unknown.

!label TIOCSWINSZ
(!B)TIOCSWINSZ (0x540c):(!b)
(!nl)
With this command one can set the window size. For this a pointer to a
winsize structure is passed via the parameter (!I)arg(!i) which contains the
required information. In this connection one should note that though the
kernel handles the call, it leaves its execution to window managers. These
also send the signal SIGWINCH if necessary.

!label TIOCGXKEY
(!B)TIOCGXKEY (0x540d):(!b)
(!nl)
This command returns the current definition of a system key (function,
cursor etc.). For this a pointer to the xkey structure is passed in the
parameter (!I)arg(!i). The element xk_num of the structure has to be filled
with the desired key:

!begin_table [r l]
xk_num !! Key
!hline
0-9 !! F1-F10
10-19 !! F11-F20 (reached via Shift)
20 !! Cursor up
21 !! Cursor down
22 !! Cursor to right
23 !! Cursor to left
24 !! Help
25 !! Undo
26 !! Insert
27 !! Clr/Home
28 !! Shift + cursor up
29 !! Shift + cursor down
30 !! Shift + cursor to right
31 !! Shift + cursor to left
!end_table

The NULL-terminated string associated with the key (the convention of the C
language applies) is returned via the element xk_def.

!label TIOCSXKEY
(!B)TIOCSXKEY (0x540e):(!b)
(!nl)
With this command one can set the current definition of a system key
(function or cursor etc.). For this a pointer to the xkey structure is
passed in the parameter (!I)arg(!i), in which the elements xk_num and xk_def
must have been set already. After the execution of the command, Fread
returns the text string (instead of ASCII-0) specified in xk_def. This
translation only happens, however, if the program has been set into the MiNT
domain with Pdomain and if the terminal is reading characters using Fread.
As the string passed in xk_def has to be NULL-terminated, one can pass a
maximum of 7 characters in this way.

!label TIOCIBAUD
(!B)TIOCIBAUD (0x5412):(!b)
(!nl)
With this command one can set the Baud rate for input to the terminal. For
this a pointer is passed via the parameter (!I)arg(!i) to a LONG value that
specifies the Baud rate.

!label TIOCOBAUD
(!B)TIOCOBAUD (0x5413):(!b)
(!nl)

For this a pointer is passed via the parameter (!I)arg(!i) to a LONG value
that specifies the Baud rate.

!label TIOCCBRK
(!B)TIOCCBRK (0x5414):(!b)
(!nl)
This command clears bit 3 of the TSR register (the break condition) of the
MFP68901 peripheral component. The parameter (!I)arg(!i) is ignored.

!label TIOCSBRK
(!B)TIOCSBRK (0x5415):(!b)
(!nl)
This command sets bit 3 of the TSR register of the MFP68901 peripheral
component. This causes a break signal to be sent as soon as the transmit
register is empty. The parameter (!I)arg(!i) is ignored.

!label TIOCGFLAGS
(!B)TIOCGFLAGS (0x5416):(!b)
(!nl)
This command returns in the lower 16 bits of the LONG pointed to by the
parameter (!I)arg(!i) the terminal (!nolink [control]) flags (i.e. the
current stop-bit and data-bit configuration). Valid mask values for
(!I)arg(!i) are:

!begin_table [r l]
Mask !! Meaning
!hline
0x0001 !! 1 stop-bit
0x0002 !! 1.5 stop-bits 
0x0003 !! 2 stop-bits 
0x0000 !! 8 data-bits 
0x0004 !! 7 data-bits 
0x0008 !! 6 data-bits 
0x000C !! 5 data-bits 
!end_table

!label TIOCSFLAGS
(!B)TIOCSFLAGS (0x5417):(!b)

terminal supports TIOCOUTQ) the function only returns when the output buffer
is empty.

!label TCURSOFF
(!B)TCURSOFF (0x6300):(!b)
(!nl)
This command switches off the cursor of the terminal. The parameter
(!I)arg(!i) is ignored.

in a WORD value to which (!I)arg(!i) points.

!label Fcntl, Process commands for
(!B)The following commands are applicable only for processes (opened as
files)(!b). To open your own process as a file, you have to specify the path
for Fopen as 'U:PROC\processname.-1'. Here the extension -1 selects your
own, and -2 the parent process.

!label PBASEADDR
(!B)PBASEADDR (0x5002):(!b)
(!nl)
In the parameter (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to the address of the
(!nolink [GEMDOS]) basepage of the process opened as a file is returned. The

(!nl)
In the parameter (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to a LONG value is returned in which
the length of the process context structure is specified. Two of these
structures lie in memory before the PCB, whose address may be inquired with
PPROCADDR. The first structure is responsible for the current process
context, while the second contains the stored context of the last system
call.

!label PSETFLAGS
(!B)PSETFLAGS (0x5004):(!b)
(!nl)
This command sets the program flags (corresponding to those in the
(!link [program header][Program header]). For this a pointer to a LONG value

!item [P_XBIOS]
= 8 (Trace (!nolink [XBIOS]) calls)
!end_xlist

!label PTRACEGFLAGS
(!B)PTRACEGFLAGS (0x5007):(!b)
(!nl)
This command obtains the current process trace flags. A pointer to these

(!B)PTRACESTEP (0x500a):(!b) (!nl)
(!B)PTRACE11   (0x500b):(!b) (!nl)
These functions should in future enable tracing of processes. The process to
be traced must be in the 'suspended' state for this; it will be reawakened
by the trace function. These functions are however not yet implemented at
present.

!label PLOADINFO
(!B)PLOADINFO (0x500c):(!b)
(!nl)
This command returns in (!I)arg(!i) a pointer to the ploadinfo structure, in

!label SHMGETBLK
(!B)SHMGETBLK (0x4d00):(!b)
(!nl)
This command returns the address of a memory block allocated with SHMSETBLK
(or a NULL-pointer in case of error). For the sake of compatibility the
parameter (!I)arg(!i) must be set to the value 0. (!B)Note:(!b) Different
processes may see the memory block at different positions in their address
space. For this reason a (!link [shared memory][Shared memory]) block may
not contain absolute pointers to data! The command is supported in MagiC as
of Version 3.0.

!label SHMSETBLK
(!B)SHMSETBLK (0x4d01):(!b)
(!nl)
A pointer is passed in the parameter (!I)arg(!i) to a memory block that was
earlier allocated with Malloc/Mxalloc. The memory is then offered for
sharing under the filename of the file with the handle (!I)fh(!i). For this
the file must be created in the subdirectory U:\SHM. The block is marked in
such a way that it will not be released at the termination of the process.
The length will be obtained and used both for the opened file as well as
entered in the directory. Invalid block addresses lead to the error-code
EIMBA or to a bus- or address-error. The command is supported in MagiC as of
Version 3.0.

!label Fcntl, CD-ROM commands for
!label CD-ROM functions

!begin_node Fcntl
(!begin_liste) [Beschreibung]

!item [Name:]
ØFcntlÆ - Kontrolloperationen auf einem File ausfÅhren.

!item [Gemdosnummer:]
260

!item [Deklaration:]
int32_t Fcntl ( int16_t fh, int32_t arg, int16_t cmd );

!item [Beschreibung:]
Die Funktion fÅhrt verschiedene Kontrolloperationen auf der Datei mit der
Handle (!I)fh(!i) duch. Der Parameter (!I)cmd(!i) beschreibt die gewÅnschte
Operation, und kann folgende Werte annehmen ((!I)arg(!i) ist dabei vom
gewÑhlten Kommando abhÑngig):

!label Fcntl, File-Kommandos fÅr
!label F_DUPFD
(!B)F_DUPFD (0):(!b)
(!nl)
Dupliziert das angegebene Datei-Handle. FÅr das neue Intervall gilt:
(!I)arg(!i) <= Handle < 32. Falls in dem angegebenen Bereich keine freien
Handles existieren, wird die Fehlermeldung ENHNDL zurÅckgegeben. Ein Aufruf
von Fdup (handle) ist also Ñquivalent zu Fcntl (handle, 6L, F_DUPFD).

!label F_GETFD
(!B)F_GETFD (1):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando gibt das nicht-vererbungs-Flag fÅr das Handle fh zurÅck. Das
Flag ist 0, wenn per Pexec gestartete Tochterprozesse die angegebene Datei
erben sollen, anderenfalls hat es den Wert 1. Der Parameter (!I)arg(!i)
besitzt keine Bedeutung.

!label F_SETFD
(!B)F_SETFD (2):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando setzt das nicht-vererbungs-Flag fÅr das Handle f.
(!I)arg(!i) gibt an, ob ein mittels Pexec gestarteter Child Processes
die Dateihandle erbt. Ein Wert von 1 steht fÅr nicht vererben, ein Wert von
0 fÅr vererben. Der Defaultwert des Flags ist 0 fÅr die Standard
GEMDOS-Handles im Bereich von 0...5 und 1 fÅr alle anderen, also
nicht-Standard-Handles.

!label F_GETFL
(!B)F_GETFL (3):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando gibt die Dateihandle-Flags zurÅck, die durch den Benutzer
verÑndert werden kînnen. Dabei handelt es sich um den bei Fopen angegebenen
Parameter mode, sofern dieser nicht durch einen anderen Aufruf von Fcntl
verÑndert worden ist.

!label F_SETFL
(!B)F_SETFL (4):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando setzt die Dateihandle-Flags neu, die durch den Benutzer
verÑndert werden kînnen (andere Bits werden ignoriert, und sollten auf den
Wert 0 gesetzt werden). Es ist nicht mîglich, den Schreib-Lese Modus bzw.
die Modi fÅr Filesharing zu verÑndern.

!label F_GETLK
(!B)F_GETLK (5):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando testet auf einen Lock auf einer Datei. Der Parameter
(!I)arg(!i) ist ein Zeiger auf eine (!link [flock-Struktur][flock, Fcntl]),
in der Informationen Åber einen Datei-Lock gespeichert sind. Falls ein Lock
existiert, wird er in die Struktur kopiert. Dabei wird in der Komponenten
l_pid die PID des sperrenden Prozesses vermerkt. Falls kein Lock existiert,
wird die Komponente l_type auf den Wert F_UNLCK gesetzt. FÅr den Fall, daû
der Lock von einem anderen Rechner im Netzwerk gehalten wird, wird die
Komponente l_pid auf einen vom NFS (Netzwerk-Filesystem) definierten Wert
gesetzt. FÅr diesen Wert gilt: 0x1000 <= l_pid <= 0xffff. Man denke daran,
daû normale PID's einen Wert kleiner als 1000 besitzen.

!label F_SETLK
(!B)F_SETLK (6):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando setzt (l_type = F_RDLCK oder F_WRLCK) bzw. lîscht
(l_type = F_UNLCK) einen beratenden Lock auf eine Datei. Falls diese eine
FIFO-Queue (First-in-First-Out) ist, muû die gesamte Datei auf einmal
behandelt werden. FÅr den Fall, daû der Lock mit von anderen Prozessen
gesetzten Locks kollidiert, wird der Wert ELOCKED zurÅckgegeben. Wenn
versucht wird, einen nicht-existierenden Lock zu lîschen, wird der Wert
ENSLOCK zurÅckgeliefert. Zu beachten ist, daû sich Read-Locks Åberlappen
dÅrfen, Write-Locks hingegen nicht. Falls eine gelockte Datei geschlossen
wird, oder der entsprechende Prozess terminiert, werden alle gesetzten Locks
automatisch aufgehoben (d.h. zurÅckgesetzt).

!label F_SETLKW
(!B)F_SETLKW (7):(!b)
(!nl)
Analog F_SETLK, mit dem Unterschied, daû wenn der Lock mit solchen von
anderen Prozessen kollidiert, nicht ELOCKED zurÅckgeliefert wird, sondern
der sperrende Prozess suspendiert wird, bis das Locking vom anderen Prozess
aufgehoben wird.

!label FSTAT
(!B)FSTAT (0x4600):(!b)
(!nl)
Ermittelt die Attribute einer Datei. Im Parameter (!I)arg(!i) wird ein
Zeiger auf eine XATTR-Struktur zurÅckgeliefert, so als ob ein Aufruf von
Fxattr gemacht worden wÑre. Das Kommando wird in MagiC ab Version 3.0
unterstÅtzt.

!label FIONREAD
(!B)FIONREAD (0x4601):(!b)
(!nl)
Im Parameter (!I)arg(!i) wird ein Zeiger auf einen Long-Wert zurÅckgegeben,
in dem die Anzahl der Bytes angegeben ist, die z.Zt. vom angegebenen
Datei-Handle gelesen werden kînnen, ohne daû der Prozess blockiert wird. Die
Angabe ist nicht zwingend korrekt, da die genaue Anzahl in einigen FÑllen
nur geschÑtzt werden kann. Das Kommando wird in MagiC ab Version 3.0
unterstÅtzt.

!label FIONWRITE
(!B)FIONWRITE (0x4602):(!b)
(!nl)
Analog FIONREAD, nur wird hier die Anzahl der Bytes, die z.Zt. geschrieben
werden kînnen, ausgegeben. Das Kommando wird in MagiC ab Version 3.0
unterstÅtzt.

!label FUTIME
(!B)FUTIME (0x4603):(!b)
(!nl)
z.Zt. keine Informationen bekannt.

!label FTRUNCATE
(!B)FTRUNCATE (0x4604):(!b)
(!nl)
Der Parameter (!I)arg(!i) ist ein Zeiger auf einen Long-Wert, der die neue
LÑnge der zu verkÅrzenden Datei enthÑlt. Das Kommando wird in MagiC ab
Version 3.0 unterstÅtzt.

!label FIOEXECPT
(!B)FIOEXECPT (0x4605):(!b)
(!nl)
Im Parameter (!I)arg(!i) wird ein Zeiger auf einen Long-Wert zurÅckgegeben,
in dem steht, ob sich die Datei in einem Ausnahmezustand befindet (1) oder
nicht (0).

(!nl)
öber dieses Kommando kann die Art des Flushings spezifiziert werden. Dazu
wird Åber den Parameter (!I)arg(!i) ein Zeiger auf einen Long-Wert
Åbergeben, der die gewÅnschte Art beschreibt. Dabei gilt:

!begin_xlist !short [Bit-1 gesetzt]
!item [Wert]
Bedeutung
!item [~]
~
!item [0]
Ein- und Ausgabe flushen
!item [Bit-0 gesetzt]
Eingabe flushen
!item [Bit-1 gesetzt]
Ausgabe flushen
!end_xlist

!label TIOCSTOP
(!B)TIOCSTOP (0x5409):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando unterbricht die Ausgabe auf das Terminal (Ñhnlich der
Fluûkontrolle per Control-S). Der Parameter (!I)arg(!i) ist in diesem
Zusammenhang ohne Bedeutung.

!label TIOCSTART
(!B)TIOCSTART (0x540a):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando sorgt dafÅr, daû die Ausgabe des Terminals wieder
aufgenommen wird (Ñhnlich der Fluûkontrolle per Control-Q). Der Parameter

!label TIOCGWINSZ
(!B)TIOCGWINSZ (0x540b):(!b)
(!nl)
öber dieses Kommando kann die Fenstergrîûe fÅr ein Textfenster erfragt
werden. Dazu wird Åber den Parameter (!I)arg(!i) ein Zeiger auf eine
winsize-Struktur zurÅckgeliefert. Falls eine Komponente dieser Struktur den
Wert 0 besitzt, so bedeutet dies, daû der entsprechende Wert unbekannt ist.

!label TIOCSWINSZ
(!B)TIOCSWINSZ (0x540c):(!b)
(!nl)
öber dieses Kommando kann die Fenstergrîûe gesetzt werden. Dazu wird Åber
den Parameter (!I)arg(!i) ein Zeiger auf eine winsize-Struktur Åbergeben,
die die notwendigen Informationen enthÑlt. Zu beachten ist in diesem
Zusammenhang, daû der Kernel den Aufruf zwar bearbeitet, die AusfÅhrung aber
Window-Managern ÅberlÑût. Diese senden auch das Signal SIGWINCH, falls
notwendig.

!label TIOCGXKEY
(!B)TIOCGXKEY (0x540d):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando ermittelt die Definition einer Funktions- bzw. Cursortaste.

wird Åber die Komponente xk_def zurÅckgeliefert.

!label TIOCSXKEY
(!B)TIOCSXKEY (0x540e):(!b)
(!nl)
öber dieses Kommando kann die Definition einer Funktions- bzw. Cursortaste
gesetzt werden. Dazu Åbergibt man Åber den Parameter (!I)arg(!i) einen
Zeiger auf eine xkey-Struktur, in der die Komponenten xk_num und xk_def
bereits gesetzt sein mÅssen. Nach AusfÅhrung des Kommandos wird dann per
Fread der in xk_def angegebene String (statt ASCII-0) zurÅckgeliefert. Diese
öbersetzung findet jedoch nur statt, wenn das Programm per Pdomain in die
MiNT-Domain gesetzt wurde und die Zeichen vom Terminal mittels Fread gelesen
werden. Da der in xk_def Åbergebene String nullterminiert sein muû, kînnen
auf diese Art und Weise maximal 7 Zeichen Åbergeben werden.

!label TIOCIBAUD
(!B)TIOCIBAUD (0x5412):(!b)
(!nl)
öber dieses Kommando kann die Baudrate fÅr die Eingabe des Terminals

(!I)arg(!i) ist ein Zeiger auf eine cdrom_read-Struktur. (!B)Achtung:(!b)
Nicht alle GerÑte kînnen diese Sektortypen lesen, und nicht alle Treiber
bieten diese Funktion an.

!label CDROMPREVENTREMOVAL
(!B)CDROMPREVENTREMOVAL (0x430e):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando sperrt die Auswurffunktion des entsprechenden CD-ROMs. Dies
kann z.B. nÅtzlich sein, wenn das GerÑt an einem îffentlichen Ort steht, und
man dem CD-Klau vorbeugen will.

!label CDROMALLOWREMOVAL
(!B)CDROMALLOWRMOVAL (0x430f):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando gibt den Auswurf des entsprechenden CD-ROMs wieder frei.

!label CDROMAUDIOCTRL
(!B)CDROMAUDIOCTRL (0x4310):(!b)
(!nl)
Diese Kommando erlaubt es, die LautstÑrke und Kanalzuordnungen der
einzelnen Audio-KanÑle zu verÑndern. Der Parameter (!I)arg(!i) ist ein
Zeiger auf eine cdrom_audioctrl-Struktur. Indem man die Komponente set
dieser Struktur auf den Wert Null setzt, kînnen die aktuellen Einstellungen
erfragt werden. (!B)Achtung:(!b) Das Verstellen der LautstÑrke ist nicht bei
allen GerÑten mîglich!

!label CDROMREADDA
(!B)CDROMREADDA (0x4311):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando ermîglicht das Lesen von Digital-Audio (DA) Sektoren. Solche
Sektoren sind 2352 Bytes groû, und enthalten pro Sektor 588 Samples im
16-Bit-Stereo-PCM Format. Der Parameter (!I)arg(!i) ist ein Zeiger auf eine
cdrom_read Struktur. (!B)Achtung:(!b) Nicht alle GerÑte kînnen diese
Sektortypen lesen, und nicht alle Treiber bieten diese Funktion an.

!label CDROMGETMCN
(!B)CDROMGETMCN (0x4313):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando ermittelt die Media Catalog Number, die theoretisch benutzt
werden kann, um eine CD einwandfrei zu identifizieren. Leider ist diese
Information auf den allerwenigsten CDs vorhanden. Der Parameter (!I)arg(!i)
ist ein Zeiger auf eine cdrom_mcn-Struktur.

!label CDROMGETTISRC
(!B)CDROMGETTISRC (0x4314):(!b)
(!nl)
Dieses Kommando ermittelt den Track-International-Standard Recording-Code,
der eine eindeutige Kennzeichnung fÅr einzelne Tracks darstellen soll. Der
Parameter (!I)arg(!i) ist ein Zeiger auf eine cdrom_tisrc-Struktur.
