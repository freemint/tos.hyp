int16_t Ptrace(int16_t request, int16_t pid, void * addr, int32_t data)

!item [Description:]
Ptrace provides tracing and debugging facilities. It allows one process (the
tracing process) to (!nolink [control]) another (the traced process). Most
of the time, the traced process runs normally, but when it receives a signal
(see sigaction(2)), it stops. The tracing process is expected to notice this
via wait(2) or the delivery of a SIGCHLD signal, examine the state of the
stopped process, and cause it to terminate or continue as appropriate.
Ptrace is the mechanism by which all this happens.

The (!I)request(!i) argument specifies what operation is being performed;
the meaning of the rest of the arguments depends on the operation, but
except for one special case noted below, all ptrace calls are made by the
tracing process, and the (!I)pid(!i) argument specifies the process ID of
the traced process. (!I)request(!i) can be:
!begin_xlist [PT_TRACE_ME]
!label PT_TRACE_ME
!item [PT_TRACE_ME (0)]
This request is the only one used by the traced process; it declares that
the process expects to be traced by its parent. All the other arguments are
ignored. (If the parent process does not expect to trace the child, it will
probably be rather confused by the results; once the traced process stops,
it cannot be made to continue except via ptrace.) When a process has used
this request and calls execve(2) or any of the routines built on it (such as
execv(3)), it will stop before executing the first instruction of the new
image. Also, any setuid or setgid bits on the executable being executed will
be ignored.

!label PT_READ_I
!label PT_READ_D
!item [PT_READ_I (1), PT_READ_D (2)] (!nl)
These requests read a single int of data from the traced process' address
space. Traditionally, ptrace has allowed for machines with distinct address
spaces for instruction and data, which is why there are two requests:
conceptually, PT_READ_I reads from the instruction space and PT_READ_D reads
from the data space. In the current NetBSD implementation, these two
requests are completely identical. The addr argument specifies the address
(in the traced process' virtual address space) at which the read is to be
done. This address does not have to meet any alignment constraints. The
value read is returned as the return value from ptrace.

!label PT_WRITE_I
!label PT_WRITE_D 
!item [PT_WRITE_I (4), PT_WRITE_D (5)] (!nl)
These requests parallel PT_READ_I and PT_READ_D, except that they write
rather than read. The data argument supplies the value to be written.

!label PT_CONTINUE
!item [PT_CONTINUE (7)]
The traced process continues execution. (!I)addr(!i) is an address
specifying the place where execution is to be resumed (a new value for the
program counter), or (caddr_t)1 to indicate that execution is to pick up
where it left off. (!I)data(!i) provides a signal number to be delivered to
the traced process as it resumes execution, or 0 if no signal is to be sent.

!label PT_KILL
!item [PT_KILL (8)]
The traced process terminates, as if PT_CONTINUE had been used with SIGKILL
given as the signal to be delivered.

!label PT_ATTACH
!item [PT_ATTACH (9)]
This request allows a process to gain (!nolink [control]) of an otherwise
unrelated process and begin tracing it. It does not need any cooperation
from the to-be-traced process. In this case, (!I)pid(!i) specifies the
process ID of the to-be-traced process, and the other two arguments are
ignored. This request requires that the target process must have the same
real UID as the tracing process, and that it must not be executing a setuid
or setgid executable. (If the tracing process is running as root, these
restrictions do not apply.) The tracing process will see the newly-traced
process stop and may then control it as if it had been traced all along.

Two other restrictions apply to all tracing processes, even those running as
root. First, no process may trace the process running init(8). Second, if a
process has its root directory set with chroot(2), it may not trace another
process unless that process' root directory is at or below the tracing
process' root.

!label PT_DETACH
!item [PT_DETACH (10)]
This request is like PT_CONTINUE, except that it does not allow specifying
an alternative place to continue execution, and after it succeeds, the
traced process is no longer traced and continues execution normally.

!label PT_SYSCALL
!item [PT_SYSCALL (11)]
Continue and stop at next return from syscall.
!end_xlist
Additionally, machine-specific requests can exist. On the SPARC, these are:

!begin_xlist
!item [PT_GETREGS]
This request reads the traced process' machine registers into the
struct reg (defined in <machine/reg.h>) pointed to by (!I)addr(!i).
!item [PT_SETREGS]
This request is the converse of PT_GETREGS; it loads the traced process'
machine registers from the struct reg (defined in <machine/reg.h>) pointed
to by (!I)addr(!i).
!item [PT_GETFPREGS]
This request reads the traced process' floating-point registers into the
struct fpreg (defined in <machine/reg.h>) pointed to by (!I)addr(!i).
!item [PT_SETFPREGS]
This request is the converse of PT_GETFPREGS; it loads the traced process'
floating-point registers from the struct fpreg (defined in <machine/reg.h>)
pointed to by (!I)addr(!i).
!end_xlist

!item [(!nolink [Return]) alue:]
Some requests can cause ptrace to return -1 as a non-error value; to
disambiguate, errno can be set to 0 before the call and checked afterwards.
The possible errors are:
!begin_xlist [EINVAL]
!item [ww]
No process having the specified process ID exists.
!item [EINVAL]
!begin_itemize !short
!item A process attempted to use PT_ATTACH on itself.
!item The request was not one of the legal requests.
!item The signal number (in (!I)data(!i)) to PT_CONTINUE was neither 0 nor a
      legal signal number.
!item PT_GETREGS, PT_SETREGS, PT_GETFPREGS, or PT_SETFPREGS was attempted on
      a process with no valid register set. (This is normally true only of
      system processes.)
!end_itemize
!item [EBUSY]
!begin_itemize !short
!item PT_ATTACH was attempted on a process that was already being traced.
!item A request attempted to manipulate a process that was being traced by
      some process other than the one making the request.
!item A request (other than PT_ATTACH) specified a process that wasn't
      stopped.
!end_itemize
!item [EPERM]
!begin_itemize !short
!item A request (other than PT_ATTACH) attempted to manipulate a process
      that wasn't being traced at all.
!item An attempt was made to use PT_ATTACH on a process in violation of the
      requirements listed under PT_ATTACH above.

!item [Beschreibung:]
     Ptrace provides tracing and debugging facilities.  It allows one pro-
     cess (the tracing process) to control another (the traced process).  Most
     of the time, the traced process runs normally, but when it receives a
     signal (see sigaction(2)), it stops.  The tracing process is expected to
     notice this via wait(2) or the delivery of a SIGCHLD signal, examine the
     state of the stopped process, and cause it to terminate or continue as
     appropriate.  Ptrace is the mechanism by which all this happens.

     The (!I)request(!i) argument specifies what operation is being performed; the
     meaning of the rest of the arguments depends on the operation, but except
     for one special case noted below, all ptrace calls are made by the
     tracing process, and the pid argument specifies the process ID of the
     traced process. (!I)request(!i) can be:
!begin_xlist [PT_TRACE_ME]
!label PT_TRACE_ME
     !item [PT_TRACE_ME (0)]   This request is the only one used by the traced process; it
                   declares that the process expects to be traced by its par-
                   ent.  All the other arguments are ignored.  (If the parent
                   process does not expect to trace the child, it will proba-
                   bly be rather confused by the results; once the traced pro-
                   cess stops, it cannot be made to continue except via
                   ptrace.)  When a process has used this request and calls
                   execve(2) or any of the routines built on it (such as
                   execv(3)), it will stop before executing the first instruc-
                   tion of the new image.  Also, any setuid or setgid bits on
                   the executable being executed will be ignored.

!label PT_READ_I
!label PT_READ_D
     !item [PT_READ_I (1), PT_READ_D (2)] (!nl)
                   These requests read a single int of data from the traced
                   process' address space.  Traditionally, ptrace has al-
                   lowed for machines with distinct address spaces for in-
                   struction and data, which is why there are two requests:
                   conceptually, PT_READ_I reads from the instruction space
                   and PT_READ_D reads from the data space.  In the current
                   NetBSD implementation, these two requests are completely
                   identical.  The addr argument specifies the address (in the
                   traced process' virtual address space) at which the read is
                   to be done.  This address does not have to meet any align-
                   ment constraints.  The value read is returned as the return
                   value from ptrace.

!label PT_WRITE_I
!label PT_WRITE_D 
     !item [PT_WRITE_I (4), PT_WRITE_D (5)] (!nl)
                   These requests parallel PT_READ_I and PT_READ_D, except
                   that they write rather than read.  The data argument sup-
                   plies the value to be written.

!label PT_CONTINUE
     !item [PT_CONTINUE (7)]   The traced process continues execution.  (!I)addr(!i) is an address
                   specifying the place where execution is to be resumed (a
                   new value for the program counter), or (caddr_t)1 to indi-
                   cate that execution is to pick up where it left off.  (!I)data(!i)
                   provides a signal number to be delivered to the traced pro-
                   cess as it resumes execution, or 0 if no signal is to be
                   sent.

!label PT_KILL
     !item [PT_KILL (8)]       The traced process terminates, as if PT_CONTINUE had been
                   used with SIGKILL given as the signal to be delivered.

!label PT_ATTACH
     !item [PT_ATTACH (9)]     This request allows a process to gain control of an other-
                   wise unrelated process and begin tracing it.  It does not
                   need any cooperation from the to-be-traced process.  In
                   this case, pid specifies the process ID of the to-be-traced
                   process, and the other two arguments are ignored.  This re-
                   quest requires that the target process must have the same
                   real UID as the tracing process, and that it must not be
                   executing a setuid or setgid executable.  (If the tracing
                   process is running as root, these restrictions do not ap-
                   ply.)  The tracing process will see the newly-traced pro-
                   cess stop and may then control it as if it had been traced
                   all along.

                   Two other restrictions apply to all tracing processes, even
                   those running as root.  First, no process may trace the
                   process running init(8).  Second, if a process has its root
                   directory set with chroot(2), it may not trace another pro-
                   cess unless that process's root directory is at or below
                   the tracing process's root.

!label PT_DETACH
     !item [PT_DETACH (10)]     This request is like PT_CONTINUE, except that it does not
                   allow specifying an alternative place to continue execu-
                   tion, and after it succeeds, the traced process is no
                   longer traced and continues execution normally.

     !item [PT_SETREGS]    This request is the converse of PT_GETREGS; it loads the
