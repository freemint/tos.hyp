!begin_node Ssystem
(!begin_liste) [Availability]
!item [Name:]
ØSsystemÆ - Control cookie jar, memory access and various system settings.

!item [Opcode:]
340 (0x0154)

!item [Syntax:]
int32_t Ssystem ( int16_t mode, int32_t arg1, int32_t arg2 );

!item [Description:]
The Ssystem call has been designed to make your life easier. Using this you
can get some closer (!nolink [control]) of the system and the kernel itself.
Via this call the kernel now supports e.g. an easy cookie jar management and
provides a safe access to supervisor memory. It's strictly encouraged to
access (!nolink [GEMDOS]) variables and system vectors via the Ssystem,
because this way is considered safe for multi-user setups.

(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) are LONG parameters specific to a particular
mode. If a mode doesn't use a parameter, it is usually ignored, but should
be set to zero for future compatibility. (!I)mode(!i) specifies a particular
action as follows:

!begin_xlist [S_OSNAM]
!item [mode] Meaning

!label S_INQUIRE
!item [S_INQUIRE(0xffff)]
Returns a zero if the kernel supports Ssystem. You can expect the function
to be present if MiNT version at least 1.15 is detected.

!label S_OSNAME
!item [S_OSNAME(0x0000)]
Identifies the operating system type. Returned LONGword contains a 32-bit
positive number, which interpreted as an ASCII string gives a 4-character
ID. For MiNT the returned value is 0x4d694e54 ('MiNT').

!label S_OSXNAME
!item [S_OSXNAME(0x0001)]
Identifies the subtype of the operating system. If this call returns zero or
a negative value, that means that no subtype is available. Otherwise the
returned value, when interpreted as an ASCII string, gives a 4-character
subtype ID. For FreeMiNT, being a derivative of the MiNT, the returned value
is 0x46726565 ('Free').

If a subtype ID is less than 4 characters long, it should be padded with
zeros.

!label S_OSVERSION
!item [S_OSVERSION(0x0002)]
Identifies the exact operating system version. Returned LONGword contains a
32-bit positive version number encoded as follows:

!begin_xlist !short [24-31]
!item [Bits]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [0-7]
Some printable character to characterize the current version, e.g.
!begin_xlist !short
!item [0x61] (`a') if alpha release,
!item [0x62] (`b') if beta release.
!end_xlist
For official releases you will always find a value of 0 here.
!item [8-15]
Patchlevel (0x55 for pl 88)
!item [16-23]
Minor version number (0x0e for x.14)
!item [24-31]
Major version number ($01 for 1.xx)
!end_xlist

Definition of an official release: every release for which a value of 0 is
returned in bits 0-7...

!label S_OSHEADER
!item [S_OSHEADER(0x0003)]
Allows accessing the @{TOS ignore} header so as to get some information from
it. Current implementation permits access to the first 256 LONGwords of the
header. The address of the required LONGword, relative to the start address
of the (!nolink [TOS]) header, has to be specified as (!I)arg1(!i). Only
even values are allowed (bit 0 of the @{I}arg1@{0} is masked out by the
kernel). A whole LONGword is returned always.

!label S_OSBUILDDATE
!item [S_OSBUILDDATE(0x0004)]
Returns a 32-bit positive value with the build date encoded as follows:

!begin_xlist !short [24-31]
!item [Bits]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [0-15]
Binary year ($07dd for 1998)
!item [16-23]
Binary month ($0c for December)
!item [24-31]
Binary day of the month
!end_xlist

!label S_OSBUILDTIME
!item [S_OSBUILDTIME(0x0005)]
Returns a 32-bit positive value with the build time encoded as follows:

!begin_xlist !short [24-31]
!item [Bits]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [0-7]
Binary seconds
!item [8-15]
Binary minutes
!item [16-23]
Binary hours
!item [24-31]
Day of week
!end_xlist

Day of week has 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday... 7 for Sunday.

The call should never return a zero in these bits, but if it does, it should
be interpreted as Sunday.

!label S_OSCOMPILE
!item [S_OSCOMPILE(0x0006)]
Returns a 32-bit positive value specifying the primary CPU type the kernel
has been compiled for. Encoding:

!begin_xlist !short [16-31]
!item [Bits]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [0-7]
Binary minor CPU ID
!item [8-15]
Binary major CPU ID
!item [16-31]
Reserved for future definition
!end_xlist

The major ID identifies a particular series of processors. Currently only a
value of $00 is defined and it is assigned to Motorola 68k series. Other
values of this field are reserved for future definition.

The minor CPU ID interpretation depends on the major ID. For 68k series,
values are as follows:

!begin_table
0x00 !! 68000
0x0a !! 68010
0x14 !! 68020
0x1e !! 68030
0x28 !! 68040
0x3c !! 68060
!end_table

This is not the same as the (!link [_CPU][Cookie, _CPU]) cookie value. The
(!nolink [_CPU]) cookie specifies the CPU physically present in the machine,
while the S_OSCOMPILE indicates the processor type selected at the time when
the system was compiled. In other words, running a 68000-compiled kernel
will return a 0x00 here, even if the machine is running 68040 or something.

!label S_OSFEATURES
!item [S_OSFEATURES(0x0007)]
Returns a 32-bit positive value specifying the state of kernel features.
Encoding:

!begin_xlist !short [2-31]
!item [Bits]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [0]
Memory protection (1 = turned on)
!item [1]
Virtual memory (1 = turned on)
!item [2-31]
Reserved for future usage
!end_xlist

This call has an informative purpose only and you cannot toggle anything
with it.

!label S_GETCOOKIE
!item [S_GETCOOKIE(0x0008)]
Fetches required information from the cookie jar.

!begin_enumerate
!item If (!I)arg1(!i) is a value bigger than 65535 (0xffff), it is
interpreted as a tag ID. The cookie jar is searched for such a tag, then if
the tag is found, the corresponding slot value is returned, or -1 otherwise.

!item If (!I)arg1(!i) is a value between 1 and 65535, it is interpreted as a
slot number, not a tag ID. Then the corresponding tag ID is fetched and
returned, or a value of -1 if the specified slot is free or does not exist
at all (a slot number past the end of the cookie jar was specified). The
first slot in the cookie jar is considered number 1.

!item If (!I)arg1(!i) is equal to zero, then the cookie jar is searched for
the NULL cookie, and the corresponding slot value is returned.
!end_enumerate

The place where the value fetched from the cookie jar will be returned is
defined by (!I)arg2(!i). If this is a zero, the call returns its values in
the (!nolink [GEMDOS]) return value (d0). If (!I)arg2(!i) is not a zero, it
is interpreted as a pointer to a memory location where the slot tag or its
value should be written to. The return value is 0 (E_OK) if everything went
OK, or -1 otherwise.

This behaviour (where (!I)arg2(!i) != NULL) is not implemented in MiNT
versions below 1.14.8.

!label S_SETCOOKIE
!item [S_SETCOOKIE(0x0009)]
Places a tag ID specified by (!I)arg1(!i) with the value of (!I)arg2(!i) in
the cookie jar. If a slot with the specified tag ID already exists, it will
be replaced with the new value. NULL-cookie is reallocated automatically and
its value is adjusted. If there are no more free slots, no action is
performed and ENOMEM is returned instead.

S_SETCOOKIE requires root euid, EACCES is returned otherwise and no action
is performed.

The call refuses to place a cookie (a value of -1 is returned) 
whose tag id contains a zero-byte.

!label S_GETLVAL
!item [S_GETLVAL(0x000a)]
Fetches and returns a LONGword from the address of supervisor area specified
as a 16-bit, even, unsigned integer value passed as (!I)arg1(!i). Bit 0 and
bits 16-31 are masked out (ignored). The call returns a zero if the value at
the specified address has to be "hidden" from reading. Currently the hidden
values are the initial PC value and the initial stack pointer value stored
at 0x00000000 and 0x00000004 respectively. Reading a hidden value may require
root euid.

If the desired address is LONGword aligned, LONGwords can be also retrieved
from the supervisor area using Setexc.

!label S_GETWVAL
!item [S_GETWVAL(0x000b)]
Fetches and returns a word from the address of supervisor area specified as
a 16-bit, even, unsigned integer value passed as (!I)arg1(!i). Bit 0 and
bits 16-31 are masked out (ignored). The call returns a zero if the value at
the specified address has to be "hidden" from reading. Currently the hidden
values are the initial PC value and the initial stack pointer value stored
at 0x00000000 and 0x00000004 respectively. Reading a hidden value may require
root euid.

!label S_GETBVAL
!item [S_GETBVAL(0x000c)]
Fetches and returns a byte from the address of supervisor area specified as
a 16-bit unsigned integer value passed as (!I)arg1(!i). Bits 16-31 are
masked out (ignored). The call returns a zero if the value at the specified
address has to be "hidden" from reading. Currently the hidden values are the
initial PC value and the initial stack pointer value stored at 0x00000000 and
0x00000004 respectively. Reading a hidden value may require root euid.

!label S_SETLVAL
!item [S_SETLVAL(0x000d)]
Places a LONGword value specified by (!I)arg2(!i) at address specified as
16-bit integer by (!I)arg1(!i). Bit 0 and bits 16-31 of the (!I)arg1(!i) are
masked out (ignored). Since this call is designed to manipulate operating
system variables located within the supervisor area (first 32k), it is
restricted to root euid and returns EACCES if called by an unprivileged
process.

!label S_SETWVAL
!item [S_SETWVAL(0x000e)]
Places a word value specified by (!I)arg2(!i) at address specified as 16-bit
integer by (!I)arg1(!i). Bit 0 and bits 16-31 of the (!I)arg1(!i) are masked
out (ignored). Since this call is designed to manipulate operating system
variables located within the supervisor area (first 32k), it is restricted
for root euid and returns EACCES if called by an unprivileged process.

!label S_SETBVAL
!item [S_SETBVAL(0x000f)]
Places a byte value specified by (!I)arg2(!i) at address specified as 16-bit
integer by (!I)arg1(!i). Bits 16-31 of the (!I)arg1(!i) are masked out
(ignored). Since this call is designed to manipulate operating system
variables located within the supervisor area (first 32k), it is restricted
for root euid and returns EACCES if called by an unprivileged process.

!label S_SECLEVEL
!item [S_SECLEVEL(0x0010)]
Resets the current security level to a value specified by (!I)arg1(!i).
Valid levels are as follows:

0: none of hardware specific system calls are restricted. This is a
'MultiTOS compatibility' mode.

1: (!nolink [BIOS]) and (!nolink [XBIOS]) calls require root privileges; any
call except Supexec and Super returns EACCES if called by an unprivileged
process. This does not apply to Setexc, which sends SIGSYS to the caller if
a change of an exception vector was attempted.

2: as above, with except that (!nolink [Supexec]) and (!nolink [Super])
generates (!nolink [SIGSYS]) in order to kill the calling process.

On values bigger than 2, EACCES is returned. If (!I)arg1(!i) is equal to -1,
the current security level value is returned.

The call absolutely needs root privileges - user processes cannot even
inquire the current security level value.

!label S_RUNLEVEL
!item [S_RUNLEVEL(0x0011)]
Reserved for future definition.

!label S_TSLICE
!item [S_TSLICE(0x0012)]
Allows setting/interrogating the (!nolink [global]) timeslice value. Values
are exactly the same as for SLICES keyword in mint.cnf. If (!I)arg1(!i) is
equal to -1, the call returns the current (!nolink [global]) timeslice
value.

Setting the timeslice requires root privileges.

!label S_FORCEFASTLOAD
!item [S_FORCEFASTLOAD(0x0013)]
Allows changing the interpretation of the FASTLOAD bit in the program
header.

On Ssystem(S_FORCEFASTLOAD, 0L, 0L); the program header bit will be used as
before, this is actually equal to FASTLOAD=NO in mint.cnf.

On Ssystem(S_FORCEFASTLOAD, 1L, 0L); , the program header bit will be
ignored and fastload will be forced for all programs.

(!I)arg1(!i) = -1 allows interrogation of the current state of this
variable.

You need root privileges to toggle the FASTLOAD mode.

!label S_SYNCTIME
!item [S_SYNCTIME(0x0014)]
Allows interrogation or changing the (!nolink [global]) file-system sync
time. The default value is 5 sec.

If (!I)arg1(!i) is a positive value, it is interpreted as a new sync time
value.

If (!I)arg1(!i) is equal to -1, the current sync time value will be
returned.

To be able to change the file-system sync time you must have root
privileges.

!label S_BLOCKCACHE
!item [S_BLOCKCACHE(0x0015)]
A positive value of (!I)arg1(!i) ranging from 0 to 100 specifies the
percentage of file-system cache to be filled with linear reads, as in the
PERCENTAGE keyword in the mint.cnf file. A negative value of (!I)arg1(!i)
returns the currently set percentage value.

Root privileges are required to use this mode.

!label S_FLUSHCACHE
!item [S_FLUSHCACHE(0x0016)]
Invalidates CPU cache entries. (!I)arg1(!i) is a pointer to the memory area
whose cache entries should be invalidated, (!I)arg2(!i) is the size of the
area in bytes. Passing -1 as (!I)arg2(!i) invalidates all cache entries. If
the CPU features separate instruction and data caches, both are flushed.

This call automatically recognizes caches in 68020/030/040/060 and handles
them as appropriate. The 68060 branch cache is automatically invalidated
too. On 68000/68010 calling this mode has no effect. This mode is in fact
just an interface to the MiNT function cpush used internally by the system.

Root privileges are NOT required to use this mode.

!label S_CTRLCACHE
!item [S_CTRLCACHE(0x0017)]
Provides an universal (among 68k family members) way of controlling the CPU
on-chip caches. (!I)arg1(!i), referenced as Cache Control Word (CCW), is a
bit-field where each bit enables (if 1) or disables (if 0) a particular
function of CPU caches. (!I)arg2(!i), referenced as Cache Control Mask
(CCM), is a bit-mask where you define (by setting appropriate bits to 1)
which bits of the Cache Control Word should be actually taken into account
and written into the Cache Control Register (CACR). This is the
(!nolink [control]) mode of the S_CTRLCACHE.

In inquire mode you can pass -1 as either argument. If the CCW is -1, the
call returns a LONGword reflecting the actual state of the caches.

If the CCM is -1, a default bit-mask is returned, where any bit set
indicates that a cache function defined by the same bit in the Cache Control
Word is valid for the processor the MiNT is currently running on.

If both arguments are negative, the call simply returns E_OK if it is valid
at all, or ENOSYS otherwise. This is the acknowledge mode of the
S_CTRLCACHE.

Bits in either argument are defined as follows:

!begin_xlist !short [16-31]
!item [0]
Enable instruction cache
!item [1]
Enable data cache
!item [2]
Enable branch cache
!item [3]
Freeze instruction cache
!item [4]
Freeze data cache
!item [5]
Instruction burst enable
!item [6]
Data burst enable
!item [7]
Enable write allocate
!item [8]
Instruction cache full mode enable
!item [9]
Instruction cache read/write allocate enable
!item [10]
Data cache full mode enable
!item [11]
Data cache read/write allocate enable
!item [12]
Invalidate branch cache
!item [13]
Invalidate branch cache user entries
!item [14]
Enable CPUSH invalidate
!item [15]
Enable store buffer
!item [16-31]
Reserved for future definition
!end_xlist

Note that no processor currently supports all of these functions and some
(68000 and 68010) have no on-chip caches at all. To figure out what
functions are valid for the actual CPU used, you should first request the
default bit-mask using the inquire mode described above. Your program should
save this mask, logically AND the (!I)arg2(!i) with it, then pass the result
as the Cache Control Mask for a (!nolink [control]) mode call.

Also note that the above bit definition does not exactly reflect the
function and even position of actual bits in the physical Cache Control
Register. The bits of either argument are arbitrarily assigned to particular
cache functions, but their position and state are converted by the system
before the Cache Control Register is written and after it is read, so that
the user program can see always the same functions assigned to bits as above
regardless of the physical configuration of the Cache Control Register.

Since changing cache configuration is (!nolink [global]) and may severely
affect system performance, root privileges are needed to use S_CTRLCACHE
(!nolink [control]) mode.

!label S_INITIALTPA
!item [S_INITIALTPA(0x0018)]
A positive non-zero value of (!I)arg1(!i) defines the default amount of
memory (in bytes) allocated for TPA space, as in the INITIALMEM keyword of
the mint.cnf file. A negative value allows one to interrogate the value
currently set. A value of 0 is illegal and will cause the call to fail and
return EBADARG. Note that even if you define a very small value, like 1 or 2
bytes, the system will round this up to the smallest size of a memory block
possible to allocate.

Root privileges are required to use this mode.

!label S_CAD
!item [S_CAD(0x0019)]
Reserved for future definition.

!label S_CLOCKMODE
!item [S_CLOCKMODE(0x0064)]
S_CLOCKMODE(0x0064) S_CLOCKMODE called with an (!I)arg1(!i) of -1 inquires
the kernel's notion of the hardware system clock. If the command returns a
zero, the hardware clock is considered to tick in UTC; if it returns a
positive non-zero value, it is considered to tick in local time. Any other
positive value of (!I)arg1(!i) sets the current clock mode. On a 0 it is
reset to UTC, or to local time otherwise.

Although this call will never really change the setting of the hardware
clock, due to the changed interpretation the clock seems to warp; don't play
around too much with it.

!label S_KNAME
!item [S_KNAME(0x0384)]
(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) specify the address and length in bytes,
respectively, of a memory buffer where a NULL-terminated ASCII string will
be written identifying the full name and version of the system kernel. If
the memory buffer is not long enough to hold the entire string, the string
is truncated down to the buffer size.

!label S_CNAME
!item [S_CNAME(0x038e)]
(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) specify the address and length in bytes,
respectively, of a memory buffer where a NULL-terminated ASCII string will
be written identifying the full name of the compiler used to compile the
system kernel. If the memory buffer is not long enough to hold the entire
string, the string is truncated down to the buffer size.

!label S_CVERSION
!item [S_CVERSION(0x038f)]
(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) specify the address and length in bytes,
respectively, of a memory buffer where a NULL-terminated ASCII string will
be written identifying the version of the compiler used to compile the
system kernel. If the memory buffer is not long enough to hold the entire
string, the string is truncated down to the buffer size.

!label S_CDEFINES
!item [S_CDEFINES(0x0390)]
(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) specify the address and length in bytes,
respectively, of a memory buffer where a NULL-terminated ASCII string will
be written containing the compile time definitions (switches) used while
compiling the system kernel. If the memory buffer is not long enough to hold
the entire string, the string is truncated down to the buffer size.

!label S_COPTIM
!item [S_COPTIM(0x0391)]
(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) specify the address and length in bytes,
respectively, of a memory buffer where a NULL-terminated ASCII string will
be written containing the compile time optimization options used while
compiling the system kernel. If the memory buffer is not long enough to hold
the entire string, the string is truncated down to the buffer size.

!label S_DEBUGLEVEL
!item [S_DEBUGLEVEL(0x03e8)]
S_DEBUGLEVEL called with an (!I)arg1(!i) of -1 inquires the kernel's current
debug level. Any other positive value will set the current debug level. If
it is a zero, the kernel will not output any debugging information, except
for fatal error-messages. The higher the debug level, the more MiNT will
spew about what it is doing.

Note that special debug kernels will output more information than an
ordinary distribution kernel.

Root privileges are needed to change the debug level.

!label S_DEBUGDEV
!item [S_DEBUGDEV(0x03e9)]
S_DEBUGDEV called with an (!I)arg1(!i) of -1 inquires the current
(!nolink [BIOS]) device to output the debug information to. The order of
defined (!nolink [BIOS]) devices is as follows:

!begin_itemize !short
!item  0, printer
!item  1, AUX:
!item  2, console (default)
!item  3, MIDI
!item  4, keyboard
!item  5, raw screen
!end_itemize

Any positive value of (!I)arg1(!i), ranging from 0 to 9, will redirect the
debug information output to an appropriate (!nolink [BIOS]) device. Notice
however, that setting device 4 (keyboard) as a debug device does not make
much sense and may produce undesired results. The system does not restrict
this in any way though, just assuming that you know what you're doing.

Root privileges are needed to change the debug device.

!label S_TIOCMGET
!item [S_TIOCMGET(0x54f8)]
This mode is reserved for the internal and exclusive usage of the MiNT
Library.
!end_xlist

Ssystem was first introduced as of MiNT version 1.14.6, but it is considered
fully functional as of MiNT version 1.15.0 release.

The S_OSHEADER opcode should be only used for fetching the (!nolink [TOS])
version number when running MiNT versions below 1.15.0 release.

The S_FLUSHCACHE, S_CTRLCACHE, S_DEBUGLEVEL and S_DEBUGDEV are supported as
of MiNT version 1.15.1 release.

You should never use Ssystem(S_TIOCMGET, ...); in your own programs.

The Ssystem behaviour does not depend on the S_SECLEVEL settings.

Any values returned by the kernel on reserved fields should be considered
undocumented and no software should rely on them.

It's strictly encouraged to access (!nolink [GEMDOS]) variables and system
vectors via the Ssystem, because this way is considered safe for multi-user
setups. For example, you can access the cookie jar pointer using the call
Ssystem(S_GETLVAL, 0x05a0, NULL), though if (!nolink [TOS])-compatibility is
the issue you should rather use (2, -1).

Prior to any further Ssystem usage, your application should first check if
the kernel supports this call. If it does, the Ssystem(-1, 0L, 0L); should
return a zero.

Ssystem is used and supported by the MiNT Library as of patchlevel 48.

!item [Beschreibung:]
The Ssystem call has been designed to make your life easier. Using this
you can get some closer (!nolink [control]) on the system and the kernel itself. Via
this call the kernel now supports e.g. an easy Cookie Jar management and
provides a safe access to supervisor memory. It's strictly encouraged to
access GEMDOS variables and system vectors via the Ssystem(), because this
way is considered safe for multiuser setups.

(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) are long parameters specific for a 
particular mode. If a mode doesn't use a parameter, it is 
usually ignored, but should be set to a zero for future compatibility. 
mode specifies a particular action as follows:

!begin_xlist [S_OSNAM]
!item [mode] meaning

!label S_INQUIRE
!item [S_INQUIRE(0xffff)]
Retunrs a zero if the kernel supports Ssystem. You can expect the function
to be present if MiNT version at least 1.15 is detected.

!label S_OSNAME
!item [S_OSNAME(0x0000)]
Identifies the operating system type. Returned longword contains a 
32-bit positive number, which interpreted as an ASCII string gives a 
4-character id. For MiNT the returned value is 0x4d694e54 
('MiNT').

!label S_OSXNAME
!item [S_OSXNAME(0x0001)]
Identifies the subtype of the operating system. If this call 
returns a zero or a negative value, that means, that no subtype is 
available. Otherwise the returned value, when interpreted as an ASCII 
string gives a 4-character subtype id. For FreeMiNT, being a 
derivative of the MiNT, the returned value is 0x46726565 ('Free').

If a subtype id is less than 4 characters long, it should be padded with zeros.

!label S_OSVERSION
!item [S_OSVERSION(0x0002)]
Identifies the exact operating system version. Returned longword 
contains a 32 bit positive version number encoded as follows:

!label S_OSHEADER
!item [S_OSHEADER(0x0003)]
Allows to access the TOS header in order to get some 
information from. Current implementation allows to access the first 
256 longwords of the header. The address of the required longword, 
relative to the begin address of the TOS header, has to be specified as 
arg1. Only even values are allowed (bit 0 of the 
arg1 is masked out by the kernel). Always a whole 
longword is returned.

!label S_OSBUILDDATE
!item [S_OSBUILDDATE(0x0004)]
Returns a 32 bit positive value with the build date encoded as follows:

!label S_OSBUILDTIME
!item [S_OSBUILDTIME(0x0005)]
Returns a 32 bit positive value with the build time encoded as 
follows:

!end_xlist

day of week has 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday... 7 for Sunday.

The call should never return a zero in these bits, but if it 
does, it should be interpreted as Sunday.

!label S_OSCOMPILE
!item [S_OSCOMPILE(0x0006)]
Returns a 32-bit positive value specifying the primary CPU type the 
kernel has been compiled for. Encoding:

!begin_xlist !short [16-31]
!item [bits]
meaning
!item [~]

!item [0-7]
binary minor CPU ID
!item [8-15]
binary major CPU ID
!item [16-31]
reserved for future definition.
!end_xlist

The major ID identifies a particular series of processors. Currently 
only a value of 0x00 is defined and it is assigned to Motorola 68k 
series. Other values of this field are reserved for future definition.

The minor CPU ID interpretation depends on the major ID. For 
68k series, values are as follows:

!begin_table
0x00 !! 68000
0x0a !! 68010
0x14 !! 68020
0x1e !! 68030
0x28 !! 68040
0x3c !! 68060
!end_table

This is not the same as the _CPU cookie value. The 
(!nolink [_CPU]) cookie specifies the CPU physically present in the 
machine, while the S_OSCOMPILE indicates the processor 
type selected at the time when the system was compiled. In other words, 
running a 68000 compiled kernel will return a 0x00 here, even if the 
machine is running 68040 or something.

!label S_OSFEATURES
!item [S_OSFEATURES(0x0007)]
Returns a 32-bit positive value specifying the state of kernel 
features. Encoding:

!begin_xlist !short [2-31]
!item [bits] meaning
!item [~]    ~
!item [0]    memory protection (1 = turned on)
!item [1]    virtual memory (1 = turned on)
!item [2-31] reserved for future usage 
!end_xlist

This call has an informative purpose only and you cannot toggle 
anything with it.

!label S_GETCOOKIE
!item [S_GETCOOKIE(0x0008)]
Fetches required information from the Cookie Jar.

!begin_enumerate
!item If arg1 is a value bigger than 65535 (0xffff), it is 
interpreted as a tag id. The Cookie Jar is searched for such a tag, 
then if the tag is found, the corresponding slot value is returned or 
-1 otherwise.

!item If arg1 is a value between 1 and 65535, it is 
interpreted as a slot number, not a tag id.Then the corresponding tag 
id is fetched and returned or a value of -1 if the specified slot is 
free or does not exist at all (a slot number past the end of the Cookie 
Jar was specified). The first slot in the Cookie Jar is considered 
number 1.

!item If arg1 is equal to a zero, then the Cookie Jar is 
searched for the NULL cookie, then the corresponding slot value 
is returned.
!end_enumerate

The place where the value fetched from the Cookie Jar will be returned 
is defined by the arg2. If this is a zero, the call 
returns its values in the GEMDOS return value (d0). If the 
arg2 is not a zero, it is interpreted as a pointer to a 
memory location, where the slot tag or its value should be written to. 
The return value is 0 (E_OK) then, if everything went OK, or -1 
otherwise.

This behaviour (where arg2 != NULL) is not implemented in MiNT versions
below 1.14.8.

!label S_SETCOOKIE
!item [S_SETCOOKIE(0x0009)]
Places a tag id specified by the arg1 with the value of 
the arg2 in the Cookie Jar. If a slot with the specified 
tag id already exists, it will be replaced with the new value. 
NULL cookie is reallocated automatically and its value is 
adjusted. If there are no more free slots, no action is performed and 
ENOMEM is returned instead.

S_SETCOOKIE requires root euid, EACCES is returned otherwise and no action
is performed.

The call refuses to place a cookie (a value of -1 is returned) whose tag ID
contains a zero-byte.

!label S_GETLVAL
!item [S_GETLVAL(0x000a)]
Fetches and returns a LONGword from the address of supervisor area specified
as a 16-bit, even, unsigned integer value passed as (!I)arg1(!i). Bit 0 and
bits 16-31 are masked out (ignored). The call returns a zero if the value at
the specified address has to be "hidden" from reading. Currently the hidden
values are the initial PC value and the initial stack pointer value stored
at 0x00000000 and 0x00000004 respectively. Reading a hidden value may require
root euid.

If the desired address is LONGword aligned, LONGwords can be also retrieved
from the supervisor area using Setexc.

!label S_GETWVAL
!item [S_GETWVAL(0x000b)]
Fetches and returns a word from the address of supervisor area specified as
a 16-bit, even, unsigned integer value passed as (!I)arg1(!i). Bit 0 and
bits 16-31 are masked out (ignored). The call returns a zero if the value at
the specified address has to be "hidden" from reading. Currently the hidden
values are the initial PC value and the initial stack pointer value stored
at 0x00000000 and 0x00000004 respectively. Reading a hidden value may require
root euid.

!label S_GETBVAL
!item [S_GETBVAL(0x000c)]
Fetches and returns a byte from the address of supervisor area specified as
a 16-bit unsigned integer value passed as (!I)arg1(!i). Bits 16-31 are
masked out (ignored). The call returns a zero if the value at the specified
address has to be "hidden" from reading. Currently the hidden values are the
initial PC value and the initial stack pointer value stored at 0x00000000 and
0x00000004 respectively. Reading a hidden value may require root euid.

!label S_SETLVAL
!item [S_SETLVAL(0x000d)]
Places a LONGword value specified by (!I)arg2(!i) at address specified as
16-bit integer by (!I)arg1(!i). Bit 0 and bits 16-31 of the (!I)arg1(!i) are
masked out (ignored). Since this call is designed to manipulate operating
system variables located within the supervisor area (first 32k), it is
restricted to root euid and returns EACCES if called by an unprivileged
process.

!label S_SETWVAL
!item [S_SETWVAL(0x000e)]
Places a word value specified by (!I)arg2(!i) at address specified as 16-bit
integer by (!I)arg1(!i). Bit 0 and bits 16-31 of the (!I)arg1(!i) are masked
out (ignored). Since this call is designed to manipulate operating system
variables located within the supervisor area (first 32k), it is restricted
for root euid and returns EACCES if called by an unprivileged process.

!label S_SETBVAL
!item [S_SETBVAL(0x000f)]
Places a byte value specified by (!I)arg2(!i) at address specified as 16-bit
integer by (!I)arg1(!i). Bits 16-31 of the (!I)arg1(!i) are masked out
(ignored). Since this call is designed to manipulate operating system
variables located within the supervisor area (first 32k), it is restricted
for root euid and returns EACCES if called by an unprivileged process.

!label S_SECLEVEL
!item [S_SECLEVEL(0x0010)]
Resets the current security level to a value specified by (!I)arg1(!i).
Valid levels are as follows:

0: none of hardware specific system calls are restricted. This is a
'MultiTOS compatibility' mode.

1: (!nolink [BIOS]) and (!nolink [XBIOS]) calls require root privileges; any
call except Supexec and Super returns EACCES if called by an unprivileged
process. This does not apply to Setexc, which sends SIGSYS to the caller if
a change of an exception vector was attempted.

2: as above, with except that (!nolink [Supexec]) and (!nolink [Super])
generates (!nolink [SIGSYS]) in order to kill the calling process.

On values bigger than 2, EACCES is returned. If (!I)arg1(!i) is equal to -1,
the current security level value is returned.

The call absolutely needs root privileges - user processes cannot even
inquire the current security level value.

!label S_RUNLEVEL
!item [S_RUNLEVEL(0x0011)]
Reserved for future definition.

!label S_TSLICE
!item [S_TSLICE(0x0012)]
Allows setting/interrogating the (!nolink [global]) timeslice value. Values
are exactly the same as for SLICES keyword in mint.cnf. If (!I)arg1(!i) is
equal to -1, the call returns the current (!nolink [global]) timeslice
value.

Setting the timeslice requires root privileges.

!label S_FORCEFASTLOAD
!item [S_FORCEFASTLOAD(0x0013)]
Allows changing the interpretation of the FASTLOAD bit in the program
header.

On Ssystem(S_FORCEFASTLOAD, 0L, 0L); the program header bit will be used as
before, this is actually equal to FASTLOAD=NO in mint.cnf.

On Ssystem(S_FORCEFASTLOAD, 1L, 0L); , the program header bit will be
ignored and fastload will be forced for all programs.

(!I)arg1(!i) = -1 allows interrogation of the current state of this
variable.

You need root privileges to toggle the FASTLOAD mode.

!label S_SYNCTIME
!item [S_SYNCTIME(0x0014)]
Allows interrogation or changing the (!nolink [global]) file-system sync
time. The default value is 5 sec.

If (!I)arg1(!i) is a positive value, it is interpreted as a new sync time
value.

If (!I)arg1(!i) is equal to -1, the current sync time value will be
returned.

To be able to change the file-system sync time you must have root
privileges.

!label S_BLOCKCACHE
!item [S_BLOCKCACHE(0x0015)]
A positive value of (!I)arg1(!i) ranging from 0 to 100 specifies the
percentage of file-system cache to be filled with linear reads, as in the
PERCENTAGE keyword in the mint.cnf file. A negative value of (!I)arg1(!i)
returns the currently set percentage value.

Root privileges are required to use this mode.

!label S_FLUSHCACHE
!item [S_FLUSHCACHE(0x0016)]
Invalidates CPU cache entries. (!I)arg1(!i) is a pointer to the memory area
whose cache entries should be invalidated, (!I)arg2(!i) is the size of the
area in bytes. Passing -1 as (!I)arg2(!i) invalidates all cache entries. If
the CPU features separate instruction and data caches, both are flushed.

This call automatically recognizes caches in 68020/030/040/060 and handles
them as appropriate. The 68060 branch cache is automatically invalidated
too. On 68000/68010 calling this mode has no effect. This mode is in fact
just an interface to the MiNT function cpush used internally by the system.

Root privileges are NOT required to use this mode.

!label S_CTRLCACHE
!item [S_CTRLCACHE(0x0017)]
Provides an universal (among 68k family members) way of controlling the CPU
on-chip caches. (!I)arg1(!i), referenced as Cache Control Word (CCW), is a
bit-field where each bit enables (if 1) or disables (if 0) a particular
function of CPU caches. (!I)arg2(!i), referenced as Cache Control Mask
(CCM), is a bit-mask where you define (by setting appropriate bits to 1)
which bits of the Cache Control Word should be actually taken into account
and written into the Cache Control Register (CACR). This is the
(!nolink [control]) mode of the S_CTRLCACHE.

In inquire mode you can pass -1 as either argument. If the CCW is -1, the
call returns a LONGword reflecting the actual state of the caches.

If the CCM is -1, a default bit-mask is returned, where any bit set
indicates that a cache function defined by the same bit in the Cache Control
Word is valid for the processor the MiNT is currently running on.

If both arguments are negative, the call simply returns E_OK if it is valid
at all, or ENOSYS otherwise. This is the acknowledge mode of the
S_CTRLCACHE.

Bits in either argument are defined as follows:

!begin_xlist !short [16-31]
!item [0]
Enable instruction cache
!item [1]
Enable data cache
!item [2]
Enable branch cache
!item [3]
Freeze instruction cache
!item [4]
Freeze data cache
!item [5]
Instruction burst enable
!item [6]
Data burst enable
!item [7]
Enable write allocate
!item [8]
Instruction cache full mode enable
!item [9]
Instruction cache read/write allocate enable
!item [10]
Data cache full mode enable
!item [11]
Data cache read/write allocate enable
!item [12]
Invalidate branch cache
!item [13]
Invalidate branch cache user entries
!item [14]
Enable CPUSH invalidate
!item [15]
Enable store buffer
!item [16-31]
Reserved for future definition
!end_xlist

Note that no processor currently supports all of these functions and some
(68000 and 68010) have no on-chip caches at all. To figure out what
functions are valid for the actual CPU used, you should first request the
default bit-mask using the inquire mode described above. Your program should
save this mask, logically AND the (!I)arg2(!i) with it, then pass the result
as the Cache Control Mask for a (!nolink [control]) mode call.

Also note that the above bit definition does not exactly reflect the
function and even position of actual bits in the physical Cache Control
Register. The bits of either argument are arbitrarily assigned to particular
cache functions, but their position and state are converted by the system
before the Cache Control Register is written and after it is read, so that
the user program can see always the same functions assigned to bits as above
regardless of the physical configuration of the Cache Control Register.

Since changing cache configuration is (!nolink [global]) and may severely
affect system performance, root privileges are needed to use S_CTRLCACHE
(!nolink [control]) mode.

!label S_INITIALTPA
!item [S_INITIALTPA(0x0018)]
A positive non-zero value of (!I)arg1(!i) defines the default amount of
memory (in bytes) allocated for TPA space, as in the INITIALMEM keyword of
the mint.cnf file. A negative value allows one to interrogate the value
currently set. A value of 0 is illegal and will cause the call to fail and
return EBADARG. Note that even if you define a very small value, like 1 or 2
bytes, the system will round this up to the smallest size of a memory block
possible to allocate.

Root privileges are required to use this mode.

!label S_CAD
!item [S_CAD(0x0019)]
Reserved for future definition.

!label S_CLOCKMODE
!item [S_CLOCKMODE(0x0064)]
S_CLOCKMODE(0x0064) S_CLOCKMODE called with an (!I)arg1(!i) of -1 inquires
the kernel's notion of the hardware system clock. If the command returns a
zero, the hardware clock is considered to tick in UTC; if it returns a
positive non-zero value, it is considered to tick in local time. Any other
positive value of (!I)arg1(!i) sets the current clock mode. On a 0 it is
reset to UTC, or to local time otherwise.

Although this call will never really change the setting of the hardware
clock, due to the changed interpretation the clock seems to warp; don't play
around too much with it.

!label S_KNAME
!item [S_KNAME(0x0384)]
(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) specify the address and length in bytes,
respectively, of a memory buffer where a NULL-terminated ASCII string will
be written identifying the full name and version of the system kernel. If
the memory buffer is not long enough to hold the entire string, the string
is truncated down to the buffer size.

!label S_CNAME
!item [S_CNAME(0x038e)]
(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) specify the address and length in bytes,
respectively, of a memory buffer where a NULL-terminated ASCII string will
be written identifying the full name of the compiler used to compile the
system kernel. If the memory buffer is not long enough to hold the entire
string, the string is truncated down to the buffer size.

!label S_CVERSION
!item [S_CVERSION(0x038f)]
(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) specify the address and length in bytes,
respectively, of a memory buffer where a NULL-terminated ASCII string will
be written identifying the version of the compiler used to compile the
system kernel. If the memory buffer is not long enough to hold the entire
string, the string is truncated down to the buffer size.

!label S_CDEFINES
!item [S_CDEFINES(0x0390)]
(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) specify the address and length in bytes,
respectively, of a memory buffer where a NULL-terminated ASCII string will
be written containing the compile time definitions (switches) used while
compiling the system kernel. If the memory buffer is not long enough to hold
the entire string, the string is truncated down to the buffer size.

!label S_COPTIM
!item [S_COPTIM(0x0391)]
(!I)arg1(!i) and (!I)arg2(!i) specify the address and length in bytes,
respectively, of a memory buffer where a NULL-terminated ASCII string will
be written containing the compile time optimization options used while
compiling the system kernel. If the memory buffer is not long enough to hold
the entire string, the string is truncated down to the buffer size.

!label S_DEBUGLEVEL
!item [S_DEBUGLEVEL(0x03e8)]
S_DEBUGLEVEL called with an (!I)arg1(!i) of -1 inquires the kernel's current
debug level. Any other positive value will set the current debug level. If
it is a zero, the kernel will not output any debugging information, except
for fatal error-messages. The higher the debug level, the more MiNT will
spew about what it is doing.

Note that special debug kernels will output more information than an
ordinary distribution kernel.

Root privileges are needed to change the debug level.

!label S_DEBUGDEV
!item [S_DEBUGDEV(0x03e9)]
S_DEBUGDEV called with an (!I)arg1(!i) of -1 inquires the current
(!nolink [BIOS]) device to output the debug information to. The order of
defined (!nolink [BIOS]) devices is as follows:

!begin_itemize !short
!item  0, printer
!item  1, AUX:
!item  2, console (default)
!item  3, MIDI
!item  4, keyboard
!item  5, raw screen
!end_itemize

Any positive value of (!I)arg1(!i), ranging from 0 to 9, will redirect the
debug information output to an appropriate (!nolink [BIOS]) device. Notice
however, that setting device 4 (keyboard) as a debug device does not make
much sense and may produce undesired results. The system does not restrict
this in any way though, just assuming that you know what you're doing.

Root privileges are needed to change the debug device.

!label S_TIOCMGET
!item [S_TIOCMGET(0x54f8)]
This mode is reserved for the internal and exclusive usage of the MiNT
Library.
!end_xlist

Ssystem was first introduced as of MiNT version 1.14.6, but it is considered
fully functional as of MiNT version 1.15.0 release.

The S_OSHEADER opcode should be only used for fetching the (!nolink [TOS])
version number when running MiNT versions below 1.15.0 release.

The S_FLUSHCACHE, S_CTRLCACHE, S_DEBUGLEVEL and S_DEBUGDEV are supported as
of MiNT version 1.15.1 release.

You should never use Ssystem(S_TIOCMGET, ...); in your own programs.

The Ssystem behaviour does not depend on the S_SECLEVEL settings.

Any values returned by the kernel on reserved fields should be considered
undocumented and no software should rely on them.

It's strictly encouraged to access (!nolink [GEMDOS]) variables and system
vectors via the Ssystem, because this way is considered safe for multi-user
setups. For example, you can access the cookie jar pointer using the call
Ssystem(S_GETLVAL, 0x05a0, NULL), though if (!nolink [TOS])-compatibility is
the issue you should rather use (2, -1).

Prior to any further Ssystem usage, your application should first check if
the kernel supports this call. If it does, the Ssystem(-1, 0L, 0L); should
return a zero.

Ssystem is used and supported by the MiNT Library as of patchlevel 48.
