<h1><a name="View_20protocol">15.11 View protocol</a></h1>
<a name="Protocol_2C_20View"></a>
<p>The View protocol was developed by <i>Peter Seitz</i> and
<i>Dieter Fiebelkorn</i> to make it possible for a GEM application
to display files (using an external viewer) without being forced to
implement a viewer for the various file formats itself, and to provide
a uniform method of communication between the application and the
viewer (so that the application can use any viewer, rather than just
one particular viewer).
</p>
<p>There are already several applications that can be used as
viewers. They are <i>GEM-View</i>(Dieter Fiebelkorn),
<i>1st-View/1st-Guide</i> (Guido Vollbending), and <i>ShowImage</i>
(Peter Seitz). When installed as desk accessories, these applications can
be instructed (by other applications) to view files.
</p>
<p>This experimental version of the View protocol is implemented in
<i>GEM- View</i> and <i>ShowImage.</i> IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
THAT ALL PROGRAMMERS USE AND EXPERIMENT WITH THIS PROTOCOL! We hope
that eventually it will become a standard. Suggestions and comments
are welcome; please send them to Peter Seitz at one of the following
addresses:
</p>
<pre>  Peter Seitz, Robert-Koch-Str.6, 63225 Langen, GERMANY
  E-Mail (Internet): seitz(at)rbg.informatik.th-darmstadt.de
                  or seitz(at))isa.informatik.th-darmstadt.de
</pre>
<p>This protocol should be quite easy to implement for both the
writers of viewers and the writers of applications. It should provide
substantial benefits for the user as well, since he will be able to
use his favourite viewer with all applications.
</p>
<p>&ndash;Peter Seitz
</p>
<p>In the following dicussion, 'viewer' refers to the desk
accessory or application that is used to display the file(s) and
'application' always refers to the program that requests the services
of the viewer.

<h3><a name="The_20purpose_28s_29_20of_20the_20View_20protocol">15.11.1 The purpose(s) of the View protocol</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="#View_20protocol">View protocol</a> was developed to allow an application to:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Determine if a viewer is already in memory (without knowing the
name of the viewer). If no viewer is available, the application can
start the viewer itself (if the name is available).
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Determine what type of files can be displayed by the available
viewer.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> View files in various formats (using the viewer) and receive
feedback from the viewer (using a uniform message protocol).
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Using_20the_20View_20protocol">15.11.2 Using the View protocol</a></h3>
<p>It is very easy for the user to use the facilities of the View
protocol. If there is a view-accessory (<i><a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a>-View, ShowImage</i>)
that supports the <a href="#View_20protocol">View protocol</a>, and the application supports the View
protocol, nothing needs to be done. If there is no resident view-
accessory (or the desired viewer does not support the <a href="#View_20protocol">View protocol</a>)
then the user should install an environmental variable called 'View'
with the full pathname of the desired viewer as its value. The way
that this can be done is described in '<a href="#Who_20is_20the_20viewer_3F">Who is the viewer?</a>'.
</p>
<h3><a name="Implementing_20the_20View_20protocol">15.11.3 Implementing the View protocol</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="#View_20protocol">View protocol</a> is based on parts of the <a href="proto_xacc.html">XAcc</a> protocol, so a
programmer planning to implement the <a href="#View_20protocol">View protocol</a> should obtain a
copy of the <a href="proto_xacc.html">XAcc</a> protocol (xacc_mt.txt).
</p>
<h4><a name="Who_20is_20the_20viewer_3F">15.11.3.1 Who is the viewer?</a></h4>
<p>First, an application should determine if there is a viewer that
the user prefers. It does this by (in this order) looking for an
environmental variable called 'View', looking for a cookie in the
cookie jar called 'View', and then looking for an environmental
variable called 'SHSHOW' (which is used by the MultiTOS desktop, too).
All these names are case-sensitive.
</p>
<p>The value of each one of these variables is the full pathname of
the viewer.
</p>
<p>The programmer can determine if one of the viewers is in memory
(as a desk accessory, usually, but it is possible for the viewer to be
an application under a multitasking operating system) using the
<a href="appl.html#appl_find">appl_find</a> system call.
</p>
<p>To use the <a href="appl.html#appl_find">appl_find</a> system call, the path and the extension
have to be removed from the name of the viewer and must be padded with
spaces to a length of eight characters. If this is not done, the
appl_find call will fail. It should be noted that appl_find is
case-sensitive, so normally the value MUST be all upper case. It would
not be wise to convert the name to upper case, however, as
case-sensitive file systems may be used under MiNT or <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a>.
</p>
<p>If the viewer has not yet sent its <a href="proto_xacc.html">XAcc</a>-identification (the
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message), the application does this now. This may be the case
if the main application does not support the <a href="proto_xacc.html">XAcc</a> protocol.
</p>
<p>If no viewer is found, the application should check the extended
name (introduced in version two of the <a href="proto_xacc.html">XAcc</a> protocol) of all
applications and accessories that have sent <a href="proto_xacc.html">XAcc</a>-identification
messages for the string '2View' (this is the application type
'viewer') or the string 'NView' (this is the generic type 'viewer').
If either of these strings is found, then the application/accessory in
question supports the <a href="#View_20protocol">View protocol</a> and may be used as a viewer. As in
the case of the environment variables, the case of '2View' and 'NView'
is significant.
</p>
<p>If there is no viewer in memory but one of these environmental
variables (or the cookie) was found, the application can try to load
the viewer itself (using the pathname given in the variable). Please
note that wildcards may be used in the extension of the viewer (a
view-accessory could be named 'XXX.ACC' or 'XXX.ACX'). If the 'View'
environmental variable was found, the viewer may be started as an
accessory as well using Chameleon or MultiTOS. As a consequence of
this, the viewer specified in the 'View' environmental variable must
be able to run as both an application or an accessory. If the viewer
cannot run as an accessory, it should be specified using the 'SHSHOW'
environmental variable.
</p>
<p>Normally the user should use one of the enironmental variables
('View' or 'SHSHOW'). These should be placed in the desktop
environment, as all applications started by the desktop will inherit
its environment. This can be done with special programs (ENVIRON.PRG,
JCNBOOT.PRG) or, if MiNT is installed, by placing the following line in
MINT.CNF:
</p>
<p>setenv View C:\<a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a>_VIEW\GEMVIEW.APP
</p>
<p>and/or
</p>
<p>setenv SHSHOW C:\<a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a>_VIEW\GEMSHOW.PRG
</p>
<p>Using <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> the environment can be set by putting a '<a href="magic_magxinf.html#UDO__23_ENV">#_ENV</a>' -
line in the MAGX.INF file, like the following:
</p>
<p>#_ENV View=F:\<a href="evnt.html#SHOW">SHOW</a>_IMG\<a href="evnt.html#SHOW">SHOW</a>_IMG.PRG
</p>
<p>The cookie should no longer be used.
</p>
<h4><a name="What_20kinds_20of_20files_20can_20be_20displayed_3F">15.11.3.2 What kinds of files can be displayed?</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="proto_xacc.html">XAcc</a> Extended name of the viewer should contain an entry of
the form 'X.ext' for every supported file format, where 'ext'
may be one of the following:
</p>
<pre>  X.ART      - Art-Director
  X.ASC      - ASCII
    Paragraphs end with carriage return, and lines may end
    with a linefeed.
  X.B&amp;W      - Imagelab image
  X.BLK      - GFA bit-block
    There is a three-WORD header: width minus one, height
    minus one, planes.
  X.BMP      - OS/2 bitmap, MS-Windows bitmap
  X.CFN      - Calamus font
  X.CRG      - Calamus raster

    list! (Hi, Dieter!)
  //X.HEX    - Hex-Dump
    This is obsolete.  It is now called 'XDump'
  X.IFF      - IFF-file
    The .IFF format in general! This should be present if any
    IFF-filetypes are supported.

    Lines end with a carriage return and a linefeed.  It would
    be nice if a single linefeed (Unix) or a single CR (Macintosh)
    would also be accepted.
  X.XBM      - X-Bitmap file

  XDump      - Hex-dump
    This is not an extension, but means that the viewer is
    able to show files as hexadecimal dumps.
</pre>
<p><b>Note:</b> [abc] means one of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'
and not the string '[abc]'.
</p>
<p>All other entries starting with 'X.' are reserved for future
versions! If you would like to add other formats, please contact Peter
Seitz. It would be wise if the entries are unique.
</p>
<p>I recommend the support of X.IMG, X.GEM and X.OUT, as these
are the standard formats for GEM data-exchanges!
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the file formats listed here that an
application supports could be a clue as to which file formats the
application will accept using the Drag&amp;Drop protocol.
</p>
<h4><a name="How_20can_20I_20tell_20the_20viewer_20what_20is_20to_20be_20shown_3F">15.11.3.3 How can I tell the viewer what is to be shown?</a></h4>
<p>Because of the XAcc2 protocol, the application knows which
message- groups are supported and these messages may be used for
communication if the application has the data already in memory (and
not within a file).
</p>
<p>Use the <a href="#The_20VIEW_XXX_20messages">VIEW_xxx messages</a> (discussed below) when the data to be viewed is
contained in a file. With these messages the application has extensive
control over what is happening. These messages may be used if, and
<b>only</b> if, the strings '2View' or 'NView' are found in the
viewer's <a href="proto_xacc.html#Extended_20XAcc">Extended XAcc</a> name. This should normally be the case, though.
</p>
<p>This may be a problem if the viewer has been started by the
application. In this case I would suggest to try to send the messages
and see what happens. If the viewer does not support them, no reaction
is given (as unknown messages should be ignored!). Otherwise, the
viewer will send a response.
</p>
<p>The viewer is <b>strongly</b> recommended to support the
<a href="proto_av.html#VA_START">VA_START</a> message! Of course this has to be tested in its protostatus
(if possible, see above).
</p>
<p>There is no explicit support of the Drag&amp;Drop protocol, as
it was mainly a MiNT-specific extension (though it is included in
MultiTOS and later in <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a>), but programs running under MiNT should
understand this protocol!
</p>
<p>All other protocols, of course, may be used to communicate with
the viewer (as long as they provide some method to determine whether
or not they are supported).
</p>
<p><i>Please</i> keep in mind that pointers to strings in AES
messages have to point to global-readable memory (if running in an
environment with memory protection)!
</p>
<h4><a name="What_20does_20the_20viewer_20do_3F">15.11.3.4 What does the viewer do?</a></h4>
<p>When the viewer is started, it should check the command line for
a list of filenames to view. To be consistent with the direction that
the Atari is moving, the viewer should support the ARGV argument-
passing scheme developed by Atari.
</p>
<p>The viewer should support the <a href="proto_xacc.html">XAcc</a> protocol, and answer <a href="proto_xacc.html">XAcc</a>
protocol messages.
</p>
<p>The viewer should use the [Alternate] + [X] key combination to
send data using the <a href="proto_xacc.html">XAcc</a> protocol messages.
</p>
<p>If the viewer receives the <a href="proto_av.html#VA_START">VA_START</a> message, it should determine
the type of the file and whether or not the type is supported by
itself. The viewer does not have to send a reply to this message. If a
reply is needed, the application should send the message to the viewer
using the <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FILE">VIEW_FILE</a> message.
</p>
<h3><a name="The_20VIEW_XXX_20messages">15.11.4 The VIEW_XXX messages</a></h3>
<p>This is a description of the <a href="#View_20protocol">View protocol</a> messages. In contrast
to to the <a href="proto_av.html#VA_START">VA_START</a> and <a href="proto_xacc.html#XAcc_20messages">XAcc messages</a>, these messages provide more
refined control of what happens to the viewed file.
</p>
<p>Please remember that these messages may be used if, and
<b>only</b> if, the strings '2View' or 'NView' are found in the
viewer's <a href="proto_xacc.html#Extended_20XAcc">Extended XAcc</a> name as described above.
</p>
<p>In general, there are four messages; <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FILE">VIEW_FILE</a>, which may be
sent to the viewer, and <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FAILED">VIEW_FAILED</a>, <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_OPEN">VIEW_OPEN</a> and <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_CLOSED">VIEW_CLOSED</a> that
are used to inform the application of what has happened to its file.
</p>
<p>The viewer is expected to answer <b>every</b> VIEW_FILE message it
receives. At the very least, it should send a
<a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FAILED">VIEW_FAILED</a>(<a href="proto_view.html#VIEWERR_ERROR">VIEWERR_ERROR</a>) message (see below). However, if the viewer
does not send an answer and the application expects one, the
application should recover by using a timeout value (ten seconds
should be sufficient).
</p>
<p>It is possible for the viewer to send other messages (for
example <a href="proto_av.html#AV_ACCWINDOPEN">AV_ACCWINDOPEN</a>) before answering the <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FILE">VIEW_FILE</a> message!
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> All strings are NULL-terminated (as in the 'C'
programming language).
</p>
<h4><a name="View_20a_20file">15.11.4.1 View a file</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FILE">VIEW_FILE</a> message is used by the application to inform the
viewer that a file is to be displayed.
</p>
<pre>msg[0]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FILE">VIEW_FILE</a>
msg[3/4] = filename // Must be global-readable (due to MiNT's memory
                    // protection)!
msg[5/6] = 0        // Reserved!
msg[7]   = 0        // Zero = new file, see below!
</pre>
<p>Notes about <i>filename</i>(9.10.1993)::
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> If <i>filename</i> ends with a slash/backslash, or
<i>filename</i> is a directory, the file-selector should be opened
with <i>filename</i> as the current path.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> If the terminating byte (0) of <i>filename</i> is followed by
another string starting with an 'X' (0x58), this string gives the file
type that <i>filename</i> should be displayed as (using the strings
from '<a href="#What_20kinds_20of_20files_20can_20be_20displayed_3F">What kinds of files can be displayed?</a>' as a guide) if possible.
This could be used to show hex-dumps ('XDump').
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This message is always answered by the viewer:
</p>
<p>If the file could not be displayed, respond with the <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FAILED">VIEW_FAILED</a>
message:
</p>
<pre>retmsg[0]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FAILED">VIEW_FAILED</a>
retmsg[3/4] = msg[3/4]  // Filename (same pointer!)
retmsg[5]   = errcode   // See below.
retmsg[6]   = 0         // Reserved!
retmsg[7]   = msg[7]    // 0 or window identification.
</pre>
<p><i>filename</i> should <b>always</b> be the pointer received
in VIEW_FILE, as only this way can the sender recognize which file was
meant in case msg[7] is zero (and - of course - no new memory has to
be allocated.
</p>
<p>The <i>errcode</i> variable may be a GEMDOS error-code (&lt;0)
or one of the following:
</p>
<pre><a href="proto_view.html#VIEWERR_ERROR">VIEWERR_ERROR</a>   - The error is unspecified
<a href="proto_view.html#VIEWERR_SIZE">VIEWERR_SIZE</a>    - The file is too large, or the wrong size
<a href="proto_view.html#VIEWERR_COLOR">VIEWERR_COLOR</a>   - Unsupported resolution or color
<a href="proto_view.html#VIEWERR_WID">VIEWERR_WID</a>     - Wrong window identification
<a href="proto_view.html#VIEWERR_MEM">VIEWERR_MEM</a>     - Not enough memory
</pre>
<p>It is expected that the viewer informs the user about the error
(by printing a message or displaying an alert box), since it will know
what the problem is much better than the application.
</p>
<p>If the file has been displayed, but <b>no</b> further
communication is possible, the viewer sends the <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_OPEN">VIEW_OPEN</a> message:
</p>
<pre>retmsg[0]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_OPEN">VIEW_OPEN</a>
retmsg[3/4] = msg[3/4]          // Filename (the recieved pointer)
retmsg[5]   = viewprot_version  // Currently 0
retmsg[6]   = 0                 // Reserved!
retmsg[7]   = 0                 // 0 = no further communication!
</pre>
<p>If the file has been displayed, and <a href="#Further_20communication">further communication</a> is possible, the
viewer sends the <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_OPEN">VIEW_OPEN</a> message:
</p>
<pre>retmsg[0]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_OPEN">VIEW_OPEN</a>
retmsg[3/4] = msg[3/4]          // Filename (the recieved pointer)
retmsg[5]   = viewprot_version  // Currently 0
retmsg[6]   = 0                 // Reserved!
retmsg[7]   = wid               // Window ID (non-zero!)
</pre>
<p>The window identification <i>wid</i> refers to the AES
identification of the window the file is being displayed in. This
seems to be a unique number representing the file, which is used in
further communication as an identifier.
</p>
<p>The currently defined <i>viewprot_version</i> is 0.
</p>
<h4><a name="Further_20communication">15.11.4.2 Further communication</a></h4>
<p>Once a file is displayed (in a window) and the viewer has
returned a non-zero window identification in msg[7], both the
application and the viewer may send each other messages refering to
this file/window.
</p>
<p>The 'msg[7]' variable will <b>always</b> contain the (non-zero)
window identification as an identifier! As this is supposed to be
unique, the 'msg[3/4]' variable should <b>not</b> be used to identify
the file (if the 'msg[7]' variable is not zero).
</p>
<p>If the viewer receives a wrong window identification, it replies
by sending a <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FAILED">VIEW_FAILED</a> message:
</p>
<pre>retmsg[0]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FAILED">VIEW_FAILED</a>
retmsg[3/4] = msg[3/4]
retmsg[5]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEWERR_WID">VIEWERR_WID</a>
retmsg[6]   = 0
retmsg[7]   = msg[7]    // The wrong window identification.
</pre>
<p>The application receiving this message must <b>not</b> use this
window identification again, since the case may be that the viewer
simply did not send <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_CLOSED">VIEW_CLOSED</a>(wid).
</p>
<p>The application can perform some operations on the file being
viewed:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> The window should be closed (and the memory used by the file
freed):
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>msg[0]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FILE">VIEW_FILE</a>
msg[3/4] = NULL         // Remove File
msg[5/6] = 0
msg[7]   = wid          // This (obviously) cannot be 0.
</pre>
</p></li>
<li><p> If the application knows that the file has been changed, or
wants another file to be displayed in the same window, it can send the
following message:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>msg[0]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FILE">VIEW_FILE</a>
msg[3/4] = filename     // This may be different.
msg[5/6] = 0
msg[7]   = wid          // The identification of the window.
</pre>
<br>On the other side, the viewer should inform the application of
what is happening to its file:
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> If the window is closed (the user closed it or the viewer
received <a href="evnt.html#AC_CLOSE">AC_CLOSE</a> or VIEW_FILE(NULL, wid)), then the viewer should send
the following message:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>msg[0]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_CLOSED">VIEW_CLOSED</a>
msg[3/4] = filename     // This may be NULL and should be ignored!
msg[5/6] = 0
msg[7]   = wid
</pre>
<br>The <i>filename</i> should be the one from the VIEW_FILE message,
otherwise it may be NULL, as no new global memory should be allocated.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> If the window was closed due to an error, the VIEW_FAILED message
may be sent instead:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>msg[0]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FAILED">VIEW_FAILED</a>
msg[3/4] = filename     // This may be NULL and should be ignored!
msg[5]   = errcode      // See above.
msg[6]   = 0
msg[7]   = wid
</pre>
<br>If the viewer does not have the ability to store the
identification of the application, it may not inform the application
when a window was closed without a message from the application. This
is very easy to implement, but may lead to unexpected results. Please
send your experiences to Peter Seitz (the addresses he can be
contacted at are shown above).

<h4><a name="View_20data_20from_20memory">15.11.4.3 View data from memory</a></h4>
<p>In Version 1.04 of the <a href="#View_20protocol">View protocol</a> a new message (VIEW_DATA) has
been added, which is used to view data that has already been read into
memory.
</p>
<p>To indicate the support of this new message, the string
'XViewData' must be within the viewer's <a href="proto_xacc.html#Extended_20XAcc">Extended XAcc</a> name.
</p>
<pre>msg[0]   = <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_DATA">VIEW_DATA</a>
msg[3/4] = data     // Pointer to data, incl. header (see below)
msg[5/6] = length   // Total length of header + data
msg[7]   = wid      // Same as with <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FILE">VIEW_FILE</a> (see above)
</pre>
<p>where <i>data</i> points to:
</p>
<pre>LONG  type;         // eg '.IMG'
WORD  head_length;  // Offset to beginning of data, word alligned!
CHAR[]  name;       // 0-terminated name of variable length
</pre>
<p>If the <i>type</i> is 0, the viewer should try to figure it out
itself. Other possible value for <i>type</i> are all file-types
listed in '<a href="#What_20kinds_20of_20files_20can_20be_20displayed_3F">What kinds of files can be displayed?</a>' but without the 'X'
at the beginning (e.g. 'Dump' means that starting at '<i>data</i> +
<i>head_length</i>', '<i>length - head_length</i>' bytes should be
displayed as a hex-dump).
</p>
<p>Please note that:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <i>data</i> has to point to an even adress,
</li>
<li> <i>data</i> has to point to global readable memory,
</li>
<li> <i>head_length</i> is even,
</li>
<li> the data of the file is found at <i>data</i> +
<i>head_length</i> and is in the same form, as it would be in a file
of type <i>type.</i>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The viewer receiving VIEW_DATA answers the same way as <a href="proto_view.html#VIEW_FILE">VIEW_FILE</a>,
but <i>filename</i> (= msg[3/4]) should be set to the value of
<i>data.</i> The application <b>must not</b> free the memory pointed
to by <i>data</i> before receiving the answer from the viewer; in
case of a timeout it should ask the user what to do.
