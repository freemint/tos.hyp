<h1><a name="XAcc">15.13 XAcc</a></h1>
<p>The XAcc protocol was originally designed for non-multitasking
versions of <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a> to allow data exchange between the main application
and any number of accessories. Since the <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> did not provide a
function to find the application IDs (apIDs) of other applications
without knowing their names, XAcc had to rely on the undocumented
feature that the main application always has the apID 0. Therefore
XAcc in its present <a class="UDO_footnote" title="refers to the XAcc definition before &quot;Classic XAcc&quot;">(1)</a> form does not work in a multitasking
environment. However, AES 4.0 provides the new function
<a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a>, which allows any application to find the apIDs of all
other applications running concurrently. This makes it possible to
design a modified XAcc that does not use any 'dirty tricks'. This
document contains a proposal for such a modified XAcc; the changes
with respect to the previous definition are small and modifying an
existing XAcc-based application should be a matter of minutes. Since
single-tasking <a href="tos_main.html">TOS</a> will still be with us for a while, applications are
encouraged to implement both 'traditional' and 'modern' XAcc,
depending on the version number of the AES.

<h3><a name="Purpose_20of_20XAcc">15.13.1 Purpose of XAcc</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a> AES functions <a href="appl.html#appl_write">appl_write</a> and <a href="appl.html#appl_read">appl_read</a> can be used to
exchange data between <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a> applications running concurrently. In
practice however, some problems need to be solved to make good use of
these two functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> There are no standard messages for exchanging data. Their
definition is the main goal of <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="appl.html#appl_write">appl_write</a> needs the receiver's application identifier (apID).
The only way to get this (before AES 4.0) is to call <a href="appl.html#appl_find">appl_find</a>,
which needs the receiver's name. Thus communication is only possible
if the sender knows the receiver's name.
<br>This problem is solved in AES 4.0 by the introduction of the
function <a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> The main application does not know when an accessory is
activated or deactivated. This would often be useful, for example if
the main application changes system variables that could affect the
accessory's behaviour. If the main application were informed before
the accessory gains control, it could reset those to their old values
and change them back after the accessory is finished.
<br>Another advantage would be that after an accessory has been
called, the main application could check if something has been written
to the clipboard <a class="UDO_footnote" title="a special non-XAcc message - SC_CHANGED - has been introduced for this purpose">(1)</a> or if other changes to the environment have
been made.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>With multitasking <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a>, the situation has changed in several
important ways. The possibility of using several 'main' applications
in parallel makes it even more undesirable to let them directly
manipulate system variables and the like; nevertheless there will
probably always remain some purposes that require such methods. On the
other hand, at least for applications using windows (the preferred
method to get the most out of a multitasking system) it is now
possible to detect changes of the active application by interpreting
the new <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> messages <a href="evnt.html#WM_ONTOP">WM_ONTOP</a> and <a href="evnt.html#WM_UNTOPPED">WM_UNTOPPED</a>. Therefore it is not
considered necessary for XAcc to provide additional means to achieve
this.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The communications protocol described in this document solves
all these problems. It was designed for two distinct purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Exchanging data of standard types between programs that have no
information about each other.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Exchanging data between specific applications known to each
other. The standard protocol ensures that program combinations from
different vendors do not interfere with each other.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A potential problem caused by this protocol should be mentioned
at this point: for single-tasking <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a> versions, it relies on the
currently undocumented fact that the main application's apID is always
zero. Without this assumption there is no way to exchange data without
using <a href="appl.html#appl_find">appl_find</a>. Although this fact is not documented, it holds for
all single-tasking versions of GEM in existence until now, both for
MS-DOS and the Atari ST (this information was confirmed by Digital
Research Germany). Of course the main application's apID may be
different in future versions, although there is no reason to change
the current behaviour for single-tasking systems. For <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> 4.0 (and
later) the above assumption is not needed anyway, so no compatibility
problems are to be expected in the future.
</p>
<p>A further requirement is that all programs not using this
protocol must ignore its messages. This should not be a serious
problem, as all GEM applications should ignore messages they do not
understand. At the time of writing no programs are known to violate
this rule.
</p>
<h3><a name="Classic_20XAcc">15.13.2 Classic XAcc</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;classic&quot; <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> protocoll was finally defined on
November 28, 1992. All known <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> applications implement the protocol
this way.

<h4><a name="XAcc_20message_20groups">15.13.2.1 XAcc message groups</a></h4>
<p>[Note: The &quot;levels&quot; used in previous <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> versions
have been replaced by this new concept. Compatibility issues are
discussed in a special section at the end of this document.]
</p>
<p>Both main applications and accessories can have widely different
needs for communication with other programs. Therefore XAcc defines
several groups of related messages <a class="UDO_footnote" title="Note: The &quot;levels&quot; used in previous XAcc versions have been replaced by this new concept. Compatibility issues are discussed in a special section at the end of this document.">(1)</a> that deal with a certain
range of data types. The message groups always indicate the messages
understood by a program, not the messages it might send to other ones.
If a program supports a certain message group, it must correctly
respond to all corresponding messages, whether it can actually use the
supplied data or not.
</p>
<p>In addition to XAcc message groups, there are the so-called
&quot;basic messages&quot;, which must be supported by any
XAcc-aware program, and program-specific so-called &quot;special
messages&quot;.
</p>
<p>The basic messages deal solely with identification, but no real
data exchange. They are already sufficient for programs that either do
not exchange data with others at all or use only special messages to
communicate with a number of other specific programs.
</p>

metafile format and the <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a> bit-image file format.
<br>&nbsp;

</table>

<p>Future extensions might include sound or spreadsheet data. In
addition, a message group could be defined to handle command
interchange between applications, e.g. for a &quot;Drag&amp;Drop&quot;
protocol <a class="UDO_footnote" title="meanwhile Atari has introduced the MultiTOS drag&amp;drop protocol">(2)</a>.
</p>
<h4><a name="XAcc_20messages">15.13.2.2 XAcc messages</a></h4>
<p>There are two kinds of XAcc messages: standard messages, which
must be understood by every participating program, and special
messages intended for communications between specific program
combinations. The standard messages have numbers ranging from 0x400 to
0x7ff, special messages start from 0x800. The latter ones may only be
sent after the receiver has been identified and is known to understand
them. The following description is only concerned with standard
messages. In addition to <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> standard messages, the <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> messages
normally sent by the <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#The_20screen-manager">screen manager</a> may be used. The most useful ones are
<a href="evnt.html#AC_OPEN">AC_OPEN</a> and <a href="evnt.html#MN_SELECTED">MN_SELECTED</a>; the latter one requires a knowledge of the
receiver and therefore belongs to the special messages.

This is the only part of XAcc which has to be implemented in a
different way for single- and multi-tasking <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a> versions. Note that
the procedure described for 'multitasking' actually only depends on
the existence of <a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a> and hence on an <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> version number &gt;=
4.0. If some future single-tasking AES supports <a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a>, the
'multitasking' initialization should be used. Multitasking AES
versions with a version number &lt; 4.0 should never exist; to be on
the safe side, applications should not attempt to use XAcc if such a
situation is detected <a class="UDO_footnote" title="NB: ASH's MagiC (even the latest version) uses AES version 3.99 despite of supporting appl_search()">(1)</a>.

<h6><a name="Single-tasking_20GEM_20versions">15.13.2.2.1.1 Single-tasking GEM versions</a></h6>
<p>The communication between the main application and the
accessories is initiated in the following way:
</p>

<ol class="UDO_env_enumerate">
<li><p> When a main application is started (or terminated), all desk
accessories receive an <a href="evnt.html#AC_CLOSE">AC_CLOSE</a> message from the AES <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#The_20screen-manager">screen manager</a>. In
response they must send an identification to the main application
according to the following format:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>     msg[0]:  <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> (0x400)
     msg[1]:  sender's apID
     msg[2]:  length of the message - 16, giving 0
     msg[3]:  program version number and message groups
     msg[4] and msg[5]:   pointer to sender's name
     msg[6]:  menu number (menu_id) as returned by <a href="menu.html#menu_register">menu_register</a>
     msg[7]:  reserved (see <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a>)
</pre>
<br>The low byte of msg[3] contains a bitmap indicating which
message groups are understood by the sender. Bit zero is set for
message group 1, bit one for message group 2, and so on. This is
independent of the message types which the sender might itself send to
others. The sender of a message must ensure that it is understood by
the receiver. The high byte is used to indicate a program version
number using an arbitrary encoding scheme.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The pointer to the sender's name is stored in a
machine-dependent format. The name itself is a character string
following C conventions, i.e. a string of characters terminated by a
zero byte. To avoid name conflicts, long names are preferred to short
abbreviations. The name must be available at the given address at any
time, it may not be removed after initialization. As the version
number is stored in msg[3], it should not occur again in the name.
<a class="UDO_footnote" title="see the section &quot;Extended names&quot; for more details on names.">(1)</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br><a href="aes_fundamentals.html#Accessories">Accessories</a> using more than one menu entry must issue one <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a>
message for each entry used. Accessories without a menu entry must use a
number of -1.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Since msg[1] and msg[2] have the same meaning for all message
types, they are no longer mentioned from now on.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> In response to an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message the main application sends an
identification back to the accessory. The format is identical, except
that there is no menu number and thus msg[6] can be used for any other
purpose if neccessary. The same applies to msg[7].
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> In addition to the <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message, the main application informs
all previously registered accessories about the new one by sending
them the message
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>     msg[0]:  <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> (0x403)
     msg[3]:  program version number and message groups
     msg[4] and msg[5]:   pointer to accessory's name
     msg[6]:  accessory's menu number (menu_id)
     msg[7]:  accessory's apID
</pre>
</p></li>
<li><p> A desk accessory receiving the <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> message from the main
application sends an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message to the thereby registered
accessory, identical to the one previously sent to the main
application.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> When an accessory is activated by receiving an <a href="evnt.html#AC_OPEN">AC_OPEN</a> message,
it sends the following message to the main application:
<br>msg[0]: <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_OPEN">ACC_OPEN</a>
<br>Just before the accessory returns control to another program, it
sends the message
<br>msg[0]: <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_CLOSE">ACC_CLOSE</a>
<br>When receiving <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_OPEN">ACC_OPEN</a>, the main application restores all system
variables it has changed to their original values (if possible and
neccessary). After receiving <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_CLOSE">ACC_CLOSE</a>, it may set them again to any
desired value.
<br>&nbsp;
<br><a href="aes_fundamentals.html#Accessories">Accessories</a> should change system variables only after sending
ACC_OPEN and restore them before ACC_CLOSE.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>There have been some problems with the implementation of
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_OPEN">ACC_OPEN</a> and <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_CLOSE">ACC_CLOSE</a> that should be mentioned. The system was
designed with window-less accessories in mind, i.e. accessories that
only display a dialog box. For these accessories, the above procedure
is well-defined. <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#Accessories">Accessories</a> that use windows however have no way to
find out if they have been activated or deactivated, because they do
not receive a message to indicate this (starting from <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> 4.0, this
problem is solved). Therefore such accessories must be careful with
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_OPEN">ACC_OPEN</a> and <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_CLOSE">ACC_CLOSE</a>. The most important thing is to guarantee that
ACC_OPEN and ACC_CLOSE always occur in pairs, and that in between no other
program gains control. How exactly this is implemented depends on the
specific application. Sometimes the best implementation is not to use
ACC_OPEN and ACC_CLOSE at all.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After initialization is completed, all participating programs
know the identity of all other ones, either by receiving an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a>
message or by receiving an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> message. The main application is
always informed about accessory activities. If in addition it proves
neccessary to inform one accessory about the activation of another
one, this can be accomplished by sending special messages (starting
from 0x800).
</p>
<h6><a name="Multitasking_20GEM_20versions">15.13.2.2.1.2 Multitasking GEM versions</a></h6>
<p>The initialization procedure is much simpler in this case. Any
application, i.e. both 'standard' applications and accessories, uses
<a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a> to detect all currently running <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> processes when it is
started. To each application or accessory (i.e. everything but system
processes) it sends an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message:
</p>
<pre>  msg[0]:  <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> (0x400)
  msg[1]:  sender's apID
  msg[2]:  length of the message - 16, giving 0
  msg[3]:  program version number and message groups
  msg[4] and msg[5]:  pointer to sender's name
  msg[6]:  menu number (menu_id) as returned by <a href="menu.html#menu_register">menu_register</a>
  msg[7]:  reserved
</pre>
<p>The low byte of msg[3] contains a bitmap indicating which
message groups are understood by the sender. Bit zero is set for
message group 1, bit one for message group 2, and so on. This is
independent of the message types which the sender might itself send to
others. The sender of a message must ensure that it is understood by
the receiver. The high byte is used to indicate a program version
number using an arbitrary encoding scheme.
</p>
<p>The pointer to the sender's name is stored in a
processor-dependent format. The name itself is a string of characters
terminated by two zero bytes. To avoid name conflicts, long names are
preferred to short abbreviations. The name must be available at the
given address at any time, it may not be removed after initialization.
It must also reside in globally accessible memory. As the version
number is stored in msg[3], it should not occur again in the name.
<a class="UDO_footnote" title="see the section &quot;Extended names&quot; for more details on names.">(1)</a>
</p>
<p>Applications using more than one menu entry must issue one
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message for each entry used. <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#Accessories">Accessories</a> without a menu entry
must use a number of -1.
</p>
<p>When receiving an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message, an application replies by
sending a message of the same format to the original sender, the only
difference being that <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> is used instead of <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a>. Applications
with several menu entries must again send one message for each entry.
</p>
<p>The messages <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_OPEN">ACC_OPEN</a> and <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_CLOSE">ACC_CLOSE</a> are not used in multitasking
systems.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The only difference between <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> and <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> for
multitasking systems is that an application receiving ACC_ID sends
ACC_ACC as a reply, whereas no reply is sent on receiving ACC_ACC. This
prevents applications from sending <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> to each other indefinitely.
Obviously the name <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> has lost its original meaning and probably
should be changed. But since the symbolic names do not influence the
actual behaviour of any program, this is not really important at all.
</p>
<p>Since in a multitasking environment every participating
application can terminate, some means must be provided to tell other
applications about this. Therefore the message <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_EXIT">ACC_EXIT</a> has been added
to the list of level 0 messages. Before terminating, any application
sends
</p>
<pre>  msg[0]:  <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_EXIT">ACC_EXIT</a> (0x404)
  msg[1]:  sender's apID
  msg[2]:  length of the message - 16, giving 0
</pre>
<p>to all applications that have ever registered themselves by
sending <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> or <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a>.
</p>
<h5><a name="Extended_20names">15.13.2.2.2 Extended names</a></h5>
<p>Experience with <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> has shown that it would often be useful to
have more information about an application than specified with <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a>
messages. For example it is sometimes useful to check for a special
feature that is not unique to a single program, but to several similar
ones. This was the motivation for the introduction of &quot;extended
names&quot;.
</p>
<p>An &quot;extended name&quot; is a character string of the
format:

additional zero byte.

<td valign="top"> - application type (human-readable)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The text following this byte (an ASCII-1, 0x31) should roughly
specify the type of application, e.g. &quot;word processor&quot; or
&quot;spreadsheet&quot;. The purpose is for applications to present
this information to the user to let him/her decide where data should
go. This is not the place for advertising hype; a word processor
should call itself &quot;word processor&quot; and not &quot;document

<br>It should be clear that the text should be understandable for
end users, especially it should be in the language used for the user
interface.

<br>The receiver should normally interpret the text as if it were
typed from the keyboard. A word processor would for example insert it

which might have been issued from the keyboard. Of course this
requires a knowledge of the receiver, as no standard keyboard command
sets exist. It should be noted that the receiver is free to use only
the ASCII-code or only the scan code, or both of them.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>This message is acknowledged after its interpretation with:

<h4><a name="Compatibility_20considerations">15.13.2.3 Compatibility considerations</a></h4>

</p>

<ol class="UDO_env_enumerate">
<li><p> &quot;Levels&quot; have been replaced by &quot;message

<br>&nbsp;
<br>The motivation for this change was that the classification
according to exchangeable data types was not really a hierarchical
one; there is no reason why a programm accepting graphics should also
be able to understand text. The new scheme makes no such arbitrary
assumptions.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>There is only one situation in which a possible incompatibility
could occur: an application following the &quot;old&quot; convention
encounters a &quot;new&quot; application and one of them indicates 2
in the level/message group byte. This would be interprets as
&quot;graphics only&quot; by one and as &quot;graphics and text&quot;
by the other. Since the number of level-2 applications was always
extremely small (in fact, the author<a class="UDO_footnote" title="Konrad Hinsen anno 1992. But obviously the extremely small number has not increased yet.">(2)</a> knows only of a single

<p>In any case it is expected that most applications will be

<p>This chapter describes developments of the XAcc protocol after
&quot;<a href="#Classic_20XAcc">Classic XAcc</a>&quot; (11/28/92). Last changes have been made on
June 15, 1995.
</p>
<p>Seit der letzten offiziellen Dokumentationen zum

zusammengefaßt worden sind. Einige der Erweiterungen sind aus
speziellen Formen des Datenaustauschs zwischen der Textverarbeitung
That's Write und der Adreßverwaltung That's Address bzw. dessen
Nachfolger no|Address hervorgegangen. Trotzdem sind diese
Erweiterungen auch beliebigen anderen Applikationen zugänglich und
die Verwendung dieser Applikationsnamen in der folgenden Dokumentation
hat nur beispielhaften Charakter (That's Address = TA und That's Write
= TW). Bei den Erweiterungen handelt es sich um:

<h4><a name="MailMerge-Protokoll">15.13.3.1 MailMerge-Protokoll</a></h4>
<p>Dieses Protokoll arbeitet aus historischen Gründen mit
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_TEXT">ACC_TEXT</a>- Messages. Das TW schickt dem TA zuerst eine ACC_TEXT -Messages mit
einem String, der mit &quot;#I&quot; beginnt und nach dem 'I' den SDF-
Formatstring beinhaltet, der dem TA sagt, welche Teile eines
Adreßdatensatzes übertragen werden sollen.
</p>
<p>Beispiel: &quot;#IA1,A2,A3,A4,T1&quot; (die ersten 4
Adreßfelder und die 1. Telefonnr.).
</p>
<p>Bei erfolgreichem Empfang dieser Nachricht wird dem TW eine
ACC_TEXT- <a href="proto_ssp.html#Message">Message</a> mit dem String &quot;0&quot; zurückgesendet,
ansonsten ein Leerstring &quot;.
</p>
<p>Nun kann TW beginnen, die einzelnen Adreßdaten mittels der
ACC_TEXT- <a href="proto_ssp.html#Message">Message</a> &quot;#N&quot; anzufordern. Bei Empfang einer solchen
Nachricht schickt TA für jedes Adreßfeld einer Adresse eine
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_TEXT">ACC_TEXT</a>-<a href="proto_ssp.html#Message">Message</a> und zum Abschluß eines Datensatzes einen Leerstring
&quot;.
</p>
<h4><a name="Remote-Mailmerge-Protokoll">15.13.3.2 Remote-Mailmerge-Protokoll</a></h4>
<p>Für dieses Protokoll gibt es zwei neue XAcc-message Typen,
nämlich:
</p>
<a name="ACC_FORCESDF"></a>
<a name="ACC_GETSDF"></a>
<pre>#define ACC_FORCESDF        0x520
#define ACC_GETSDF          0x521
</pre>
<p>TA sendet dem TW ein ACC_FORCESDF, wenn eine Adresse oder eine
Adreßliste an das TW geschickt werden soll. Im Falle, daß es sich
nur um eine Adresse handelt, steht in msg[4]+[5] ein Pointer auf das
Suchwort der Adresse, bei einer Adreßliste steht in msg[4]+[5] ein
Pointer auf &quot;#L&quot;. Die ACC_FORCESDF-message muß mit einem
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACK">ACC_ACK</a> bestätigt werden (msg[3]==1 -&gt; OK und msg[3]==0 -&gt;
<a href="bios_errors.html#ERROR">ERROR</a>).
</p>
<p>Wenn TW ein &quot;#L&quot; bekommst, dann fährt TW ein ganz
normales MailMerge- Protokoll (eingangs erklärt). Wenn TW ein
Suchwort bekommt (max. 20 Zeichen lang), dann fordert TW beim TA diese
Adresse mittels ACC_GETSDF an. Die ACC_GETSDF-message muß in
msg[4]+[5] einen Pointer auf einen Buffer haben, in dem zuerst das
Suchwort mit abschließendem '\0' steht und dann der XDF-Formatstring
steht (Bsp.: &quot;JÖRG\0A1,A2,A3\0&quot;).
</p>
<p>Wenn TA die ACC_GETSDF-message verstehen kann, dann schickt es
ein <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACK">ACC_ACK</a> mit msg[3]==1, ansonsten ein <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACK">ACC_ACK</a> mit msg[3]==0.
Anschließend bekommt TW die Daten dieser einen Adresse wie beim
normalen MailMerge- Protokoll.
</p>
<p>TW muß in seinem XDSC-String ein &quot;XRM&quot; zu stehen
haben, damit TA von sich aus ein Remote-Mailmerge-Protokoll startet.
</p>
<p>TA hat jetzt folgende XDSC-Features (Bsp. ACC):
</p>
<pre>const char ta2Ident[] = &quot;That's Address ACC\0XDSC\0&quot;
                        &quot;1Adressverwaltung\0&quot;
                        &quot;2DB\0&quot;
                        &quot;XMM\0XSU\0XDI\0XRM\0NnoAddress ACC\0&quot;;

<a name="ACC_GETDSI"></a>
<a name="ACC_DSINFO"></a>
<a name="ACC_FILEINFO"></a>
<p>Im Prinzip läuft das ganze Inquiry-Protokoll in 2 Stufen ab.
Zuerst werden die Daten der verfügbaren Datenbanken ermittelt, und
anschließend (zeitlich voneinander völlig unabhängig) werden die
einzelnen Felder einer ausgewählten Datenbank erfragt.

<p>Applikationen, die oben beschriebene Protokollelemente
unterstützen, müssen in ihrer XDSC-Beschreibung das Extended-Feature
&quot;RQ&quot; enthalten haben.
</p>
<h3><a name="Example:_20no_7CLink_27s_20XAcc_20protocol">15.13.4 Example: no|Link's XAcc protocol</a></h3>
<p>Das no|Link-Accessory wurde für die Ansteuerung von
Infrarotgeräten konzipiert und beinhaltet eine
XAcc-Kommunikationsschicht für die Ansteuerung durch spezielle
Applikationen. Zum momentanen Zeitpunkt wird das Media-Link-Interface
von Catch Computer unterstützt. Eine weitere Anpassung an das
no|Remote-Interface von no|Software ist in Arbeit.
</p>
<p>Das no|Link-Accessory verwaltet alle Informationen, die zur
Ansteuerung der verwendeten Infrarot- oder sonstiger Hardware
benötigt werden. Jedem hardwareabhängigen Code (z.B einem
Infrarotsignal) wird ein Befehl zugeordnet, und für jedes Gerät
(z.B. Videorekorder) existiert eine Liste solcher Befehle.
</p>
<p>Will nun z.B. eine Applikation für die Fernbedienung eines
Videorekorders ein Infrarotsignal für die Play-Taste senden, so
schickt es no|Link eine XAcc-Nachricht, in der das Kommando
&lt;senden&gt;, das Gerät &lt;VIDEOREKORDER&gt; und der Befehl
&lt;PLAY&gt; codiert sind.
</p>
<p>Damit eine Applikation mit no|Link vollständig kommunizieren
kann, muß diese das <a href="#Request_2FReply-Protokoll">Request/Reply-Protokoll</a> unterstützen, was als
Extended- Feature in der XDSC-Beschreibung durch ein &quot;RQ&quot;
bekannt gemacht wird. Nur so ist es möglich, die Liste der
eingetragenen Geräte von no|Link erhalten zu können.
</p>
<p>Wenn die Applikation auch Codes vom Accessory empfangen können
will (nur mit entsprechender Hardware möglich), so muß als
Extended-Feature in der XDSC-Beschreibung zusätzlich ein
&quot;RR&quot; (Remote Receive) enthalten sein. Alle Applikationen,
die mit noLink arbeiten wollen, müssen den XAcc-Level 1
unterstützen.
</p>
<p>Als Application-Type enthält das no|Link-Accessory im XDSC
&quot;\2RC&quot; (Remote Control).
</p>
<p>Die vollständige XAcc-Identifikation von no|Link lautet zur
Zeit folgendermaßen (in C-Syntax):
</p>
<pre>    char xaccNoLinkIdent[] =    &quot;Infrarot Manager\0&quot;
                                &quot;XDSC\0&quot;
                                &quot;1Fernsteuerschnittstelle\0&quot;
                                &quot;2RC\0&quot;
                                &quot;XRQ\0&quot;
                                &quot;NnoRci\0&quot;;
</pre>
<p>Eine denkbare XAcc-Identifikation für eine
no|Link-Applikation könnte so aussehen:
</p>
<pre>    char xaccIdentstring[] =    &quot;VideoControl\0&quot;
                                &quot;XDSC\0&quot;
                                &quot;1Video Fernbedienung\0&quot;
                                &quot;XRQ\0&quot;
                                &quot;Nno|Video ACC\0&quot;;
</pre>
<p>Die Kommunikation zwischen Applikation und dem no|Link-Accessory
findet hauptsächlich über ACC_TEXT Messages statt.
</p>
<p>Das Accessory versteht zur Zeit folgende Befehle, die als String
mittels einer <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_TEXT">ACC_TEXT</a> <a href="proto_ssp.html#Message">Message</a> versendet werden müssen (&lt;X&gt; :=
&lt;Gerät&gt;:&lt;Befehl&gt;):

<br>Insbesondere bei der Neuinstallation einer Fernsteuerungs-
Applikation sollten alle Geräte und Befehle, die diese Applikation
verwendet, dem Accessory mitgeteilt werden!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Wenn no|Link den mitgelieferten Befehl nicht kennt, so wird der
Benutzer aufgefordert, die nötige &quot;Lernprozedur&quot; zu
tätigen bzw. dem neuen Befehl einen schon vorhandenen zuzuweisen.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Es sollte in jeder Fernsteuerungsapplikation eine Funktion
geben, die es dem Benutzer ermöglicht, alle unterstützten Befehle zu

&quot;Anmelden&quot;-Button.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Die Testfunktion ist die einzige, die u.U. eine Interaktion mit
dem Benutzer führt. Alle anderen vollführen keine Ausgabe.

der in msg[3] der Erfolg der Behandlung des Befehls vermerkt ist:

<p>Geräte- und Befehlsnamen dürfen maximal 32 Zeichen lang sein
und dürfen KEINEN ':' enthalten. Es wird nicht zwischen Groß- und
Kleinschreibung unterschieden.
</p>
<p>Eine Applikation kann vom Accessory eine Liste der eingetragenen
Geräte anfordern. Hierfür muß die Applikation das neue <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a>-
<a href="#Request_2FReply-Protokoll">Request/Reply-Protokoll</a> verstehen (siehe oben bzw. <a href="#XACC.H">XACC.H</a>).
</p>
<p>Um die Liste anzufordern, wird von der Applikation ein ACC_REQUEST an
das Accessory geschickt, wobei diese Nachricht folgendermaßen
aufgebaut sein muß:
</p>
<pre>    msg[0] = <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_REQUEST">ACC_REQUEST</a> (0x480)
    msg[1] = apid
    msg[2] = 0

    msg[5] = 0
    msg[6] = 0
    msg[7] = 0

<p>Als Antwort erhält die Applikation, wenn ein Fehler auftrat
eine <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACK">ACC_ACK</a>- <a href="proto_ssp.html#Message">Message</a> mit msg[3] == 0, oder bei Erfolg eine ACC_REPLY-

    msg[3] = 0x02       /* Datentyp: Environment-String */
    msg[4]+msg[5] = Pointer auf einen global zugreifbaren
                    Speicher, in dem die Liste der Geräte
                    in folgendem Format steht:

    msg[6]+msg[7] = long-value, der die Größe des Buffers
                    angibt (inkl. der abschließenden zwei
