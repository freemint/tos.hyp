Modern GEM applications often include a bewildering array of options
and icons which take time to learn. Even after learning a program
interface a short break away from the keyboard often triggers amnesia!

The solution?

BubbleGEM! Programmers supporting this cute little program can add
speech bubble help to their user interface making it much easier for
users to find their way around.

!begin_node How to call BubbleGEM?
!ignore_index

There are two fundamental ways to call (!nolink [BubbleGEM]). The following
example code snippet describes the simplest way to call (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) from
non-modal dialogs and window-dialogs. Since (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) Release 05 it's
now also possible to call (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) from modal dialogs.

Before every Bubble-call, supporting applications search via
appl_find("BUBBLE ") for the (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) (!nolink [AES]) application identification
number (bubble_id). Once the (!nolink [AES]) ID has been received, a message
BUBBLEGEM_SHOW (hexadecimal: 0xBABB) can be sent to the ap_id and
should receive a BUBBLEGEM_ACK (0xBABC) message in reply.

It is important the character string passed is NULL-terminated, 255
characters maximum and (!nolink [global]) legible - otherwise this leads to memory
corruption in systems with memory protection. Always request (!nolink [global])
memory.

The message BUBBLEGEM_SHOW should be sent out as soon as the the right
mouse button is pressed - don't wait until the button is released!

The mouse coordinates are passed using x and y and these are used to
determine where the speech bubble will be drawn. Calls for (!nolink [BubbleGEM])
may only be instigated from non-modal dialogs.

Changes to (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) bubbles are updated automatically, however, you
can intervene manually using the vertical line "|" character.
Preceding or following space characters are not necessary.

C example:

!label BUBBLEGEM_SHOW
!begin_verbatim
#include <portab.h>

/* BUBBLEGEM_SHOW - Message:
 * msg[0]   0xBABB
 * msg[1]   ap_id
 * msg[2]   0
 * msg[3]   mouse X
 * msg[4]   mouse Y
 * msg[5/6] to NULL-terminated character string in global memory
 * msg[7]   0
 */

if ((get_cookie (MagX_COOKIE, &val) == TRUE) ||
     (get_cookie (MiNT_COOKIE, &val) == TRUE))
{
        bubble_text = (BYTE *) Mxalloc (256, 0 | MGLOBAL);
}
else
        bubble_text = (BYTE *) Malloc (256);

if (!bubble_text)               /* Pointer invalid, no memory there */
        return;

if (right_mouse key_button_pressed)
{
    /* fill buffer */
    strcpy(bubble_text, "My first help speech bubble.");

    bubble_id = appl_find("BUBBLE  ");

    if (bubble_id >= 0)
    {
        msg[0] = BUBBLEGEM_SHOW;
        msg[1] = ap_id;
        msg[2] = 0;
        msg[3] = x;
        msg[4] = y;
        msg[5] = (WORD)(((LONG) bubble_text >> 16) & 0x0000ffff);
        msg[6] = (WORD)((LONG) bubble_text & 0x0000ffff);
        msg[7] = 0;
        if (appl_write(bubble_id, 16, msg) == 0)
        {
            /* Error */
        }
    }
}
!end_verbatim

!label BUBBLEGEM_ACK
A reply message BUBBLEGEM_ACK (0xBABC) is received with the pointer to
the character string, whose memory can now be released. The array
elements 2, 3, 4 and 7 are set to null (zeroed). On non-modal calls
the BUBBLEGEM_ACK comes only after closing the bubble!

!begin_verbatim
/* BUBBLEGEM_ACK (0xBABC)
 *
 * msg[0]   0xBABC
 * msg[1]   ap_id
 * msg[2]   0
 * msg[3]   0
 * msg[4]   0
 * msg[5/6] Pointer from BUBBLEGEM_SHOW
 * msg[7]   Same value as msg[7] on sending BUBBLEGEM_SHOW;
 *          presently 0.
 */

/* example code snippet */

pointer = *(BYTE **) &msg[5];

if (pointer)
  Mfree(pointer)
!end_verbatim

To make translation into other languages easier, please consider
storing the character strings externally, for example in the resource
file (RSC) or a separate ASCII file.

If on BUBBLEGEM_SHOW the bit BGS7_MOUSE (0x0004) in msg[7] is set,
the passed coordinates are only used for drawing; (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) ascertains
the mouse coordinates, which can be used to recognize mouse movement
(leading to bursting the bubble) shortly before automatically re-
displaying the bubble.

The procedure to call (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) from modal dialogs (see also the call
routine) proceeds similarly to calls from non-modal dialogs, assuming
the BGEM cookie is available, except BGS7_USRHIDE (0x0001) is set in
msg[7] instead.
!label BUBBLEGEM_HIDE
Additionally, after evaluating the mouse coordinates through the
calling application, BUBBLEGEM_HIDE (0xbabf) must be sent to (!nolink [BubbleGEM]).
The evaluation of the mouse and keys on calling modal dialogs is the
responsibility of the calling application.

On systems without wind_update, testmode is possible. Double help
texts can be displayed (directly above one another). Currently this
is not possible otherwise.

!begin_node Time-controlled call
!ignore_index

The configuration from applications is simply:
!label BUBBLEGEM_REQUEST
!begin_itemize
   !item On receipt from BUBBLEGEM_REQUEST (0xBABA), (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) is called
     normally (certainly with the coordinates from BUBBLEGEM_REQUEST)
     to determine, after ascertaining the received coordinates, if
     help is available for this position.


   !item The message BUBBLEGEM_REQUEST is made up as follows:
     msg[0]:=BUBBLEGEM_REQUEST; (!nl)
     msg[1]:=demonID;  (!nl)
     msg[2]:=0;  (!nl)
     msg[3]:=winID; { (!nolink [AES]) ID of the window under the mouse cursor }  (!nl)
     msg[4]:=mX; ~~~{ mouse coordinates }  (!nl)
     msg[5]:=mY;  (!nl)
     msg[6]:=KStat; { Status of the [Shift] keys }  (!nl)
     msg[7]:=0;


   !item The time-controlled help only functions non-modally.

   !item For the help demon to function the System must support
     wind_get(WF_OWNER).

   !item The demon is on if bit BGC_DEMONACTIVE (0x0008) in the BHLP-Cookie
     is set; after changes BUBBLEGEM_REQUEST (msg[3..7] nulled) sent
     to BUBBLE.APP (previously HLPDEMON.APP)

   !item If BGC_TOPONLY (0x0010) is set, the help demon is only active for
     the topped window.

   !item On/off switching the help-demon by VA_START (although using the
     CPX is better because the state can be saved):
     "-demonon" (="-demon1"), "-demonoff" (="-demon0").

   !item The demon-timer defaults to 200ms. It can be changed in the
     (!I)dtimer(!i) field of the (!link [BGEM cookie][BubbleGEM cookies]).
!end_itemize

!end_node


!begin_node BubbleGEM cookies

BHLP:

(!nolink [BubbleGEM]) evaluates the cookie "BHLP". The top WORD sets the minimum
visible time a bubble is displayed; the default setting is 200
milliseconds. The lower WORD is a bitmap; if bit 0 is set (0x0001 =
BGC_FONTCHANGED), this means the FONT_CHANGED message will be
evaluated. If BGC_NOWINSTYLE (0x0002) (i.e. no-win-style, not now-in-
style) set, the bubble help will be displayed as a speech balloon.
Conversely a deleted bit corresponds to Windows-help style display. A
bit set in BGC_SENDKEY (0x0004) means AV_SENDKEY is sent to the caller
after closing the bubble via a keypress. BGC_DEMONACTIVE (0x0008) means
the demon is switched on. BGC_TOPONLY (0x0010) decides whether the help
demon is only active for the topped window.

BGEM:

In addition, the BGEM cookie is placed in the cookie jar. It is
available only on launching (!nolink [BubbleGEM]), therefore it is (!nolink [installed]) on
starting (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) and removed with AP_TERM.
!begin_verbatim
 typedef struct
 {
   long   magic;   /* 'BGEM'                                      */
   long   size;    /* Size of the structure, currently 18         */
   int    release; /* Currently 7, never smaller than 5           */
   int    active;  /* <>0, if immediately help is displayed;
                        0  otherwise                              */
   MFORM *mhelp;   /* Pointer to help-mouse form                  */
   int    dtimer;  /* Demon-timer; Default 200ms; from Release 06 */
 } BGEM;
!end_verbatim

The structure lies in the (!nolink [global]) memory. (!B)Important:(!b) (!I)dtimer(!i) is
the (!B)only(!b) field released for read (!B)and(!b) write. All other fields are
(!B)read only(!b)!

!end_node


!begin_node BubbleGEM environmental variable
!ignore_index

If you want to start (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) manually and it doesn't run, try
setting the 'BUBBLEGEM' environmental variable. This specifies the
absolute path to (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) including the program name. For example
with MagiC, something like:

 #_ENV BUBBLEGEM=D:\TOOLS\BUBBLE\BUBBLE.APP

!end_node


!begin_node Font-selection
!ignore_index

!label BUBBLEGEM_ASKFONT
!label BUBBLEGEM_FONT
On starting (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) a BUBBLEGEM_ASKFONT message will be sent to the
AV-Server or the application with the (!nolink [AES]) ID 0. This should be
answered with a BUBBLEGEM_FONT message (Jinnee supports this).
!begin_verbatim
msg[0] = BUBBLEGEM_ASKFONT;
msg[1] = apID;
msg[2] = 0;
msg[3] = 0;
msg[4] = 0;
msg[5] = 0;
msg[6] = 0;
msg[7] = 0;

msg[0] = BUBBLEGEM_FONT;
msg[1] = apID;
msg[2] = 0;
msg[3] = FontID;
msg[4] = FontPt;
msg[5] = 0;
msg[6] = 0;
msg[7] = 0;
!end_verbatim

If (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) receives this message, it immediately takes the font with
the ID msg[3] and the point size from msg[4] to display help bubbles.
The ID and point size is adopted without checking validity.
Additionally (!nolink [BubbleGEM]) reacts to FONT_CHANGED if the corresponding
checkbox is active in the CPX module.

!end_node


!begin_node AV_SENDCLICK, BubbleGEM
!ignore_index

!begin_verbatim
msg[0] = AV_SENDCLICK  /* 0x4709 */
msg[1] = ap_id;
msg[2] = 0;
msg[3] = ev_mmox;
msg[4] = ev_mmoy;
msg[5] = ev_mmobutton;
msg[6] = ev_mmokstate;
msg[7] = ev_mbreturn;
!end_verbatim

AV_SENDCLICK will be sent if the bubble was closed by clicking (as
opposed bursting bubbles by (!B)releasing(!b) the mouse button!).

AV_SENDCLICK is the counterpart to AV_SENDKEY.
