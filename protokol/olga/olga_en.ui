!label Linking, Object

The OLGA protocol ((!B)O(!b)bject (!B)L(!b)inking for (!B)G(!b)EM(!B) A(!b)pplications)
was developed by (!I)Thomas Much(!i), and permits object linking under GEM too.

(!B)As this concept may not be familiar to all readers, first a possible
example of its application:(!b) Imagine you are using your text processor
and would like to enhance your document with a graphic. After placing
your graphic in the text, you decide to alter it slightly. Normally
you would have to switch over to your graphics program, perform the
desired changes there, switch back to the text processor, discard the
old graphic, then import and position the new one. But if both of the
applications (i.e. graphics program and text processor) support the
OLGA protocol, the solution of this task could look as follows: You
switch to the graphics program, modify the graphic there, and after
saving it you are finished! Because the text processor (!I)automatically(!i)
recognizes that the graphic has been altered, and itself replaces it
in the document!

The above example presupposes a multitasking operating system such as
MagiC or MultiTOS. And in fact: Single-(!nolink [TOS]) systems are not supported
by OLGA (since Rev. 1.0 - earlier versions could also be run as desk
accessories.) Those wanting to involve themselves closer with the OLGA
protocol should take note of the following points:

!begin_itemize !short
!item (!link [Initialization and termination][OLGA initialization])
!item (!link [Functions of a Server][OLGA-Server])
!item (!link [Functions of a Client][OLGA-Client])
!item (!link [The Info file format][OLGA Info file format])
!end_itemize

OLGA works in a (!I)document centred(!i) manner, i.e. the protocol is
prepared for one application handling multiple documents (possibly
even of different data-types). For controlling the object linking,
use is made of a so-called (!B)OLGA-Manager(!b) (in short: Manager).
Communication between the applications is transacted wholly via this
Manager (which, by the way, can be present only (!I)once(!i) in the system).

The illustration below shows a simple model of OLGA communication.
!ifdest [html]
!ifset [No_Bilder_Pfad]
!image olga_1
!else
!image (!picture_path)\olga_1
!endif
!else
!image (!picture_path)\olga_1
!endif

The actual object linking is realized in OLGA with so-called (!B)links(!b):
these are references from the (!link [Client][OLGA-Client]) to data objects, or more exactly
filenames with (!I)absolute(!i) path, which are saved by the Client in a
document. If now the (!link [Server][OLGA-Server]) makes changes to an object for which
a link exists, then the Client is informed of this (by the Manager),
and can then update itself to display the updated object.

From Rev 1.2 (1996-11-20) onwards, extra functions were added and the
OLGA architecture model now looks like this:
!ifdest [html]
!ifset [No_Bilder_Pfad]
!image olga_4
!else
!image (!picture_path)\olga_4
!endif
!else
!image (!picture_path)\olga_4
!endif
The above illustration shows the distribution of services between the
OLGA-Manager and the applications using it (i.e. (!link [Client][OLGA-Client]) or (!link [Server][OLGA-Server])).
During linking, InplaceDrawing and Notification, the correct balance
of communication between Manager and application for the embedding
is the sole responsibility of the Client application.

Finally, the Info files are co-ordinated by the Manager but then
operate directly between Server and Client applications. Schematically
communcations are handled something like this:
!ifdest [html]
!ifset [No_Bilder_Pfad]
!image olga_3
!else
!image (!picture_path)\olga_3
!endif
!else
!image (!picture_path)\olga_3
!endif

!begin_node OLGA initialization

(!U)Initialization and termination with OLGA(!u)

The OLGA protocol corresponds to the OLE protocol, which enables
object embedding with OEP (object exchange protocol) and object
linking with OLGA. As it may be sensible to support both variants in
an application, (!I)both(!i) protocols (i.e. OLGA und OEP) are initialized
with the same messages, possibly (!I)simultaneously(!i)(!)

The routines required to register and deregister themselves run as
follows:

!begin_itemize !short
!item OLE_EXIT~~~~~Disengage from the protocol
!item OLE_INIT~~~~~Register application with the Manager
!item OLE_NEW~~~~~~Manager was launched in parallel
!item OLGA_INIT~~~~Verification of registration with (!nolink [OLE_INIT]).
!end_itemize

As already mentioned. the communication between the OLGA applications
proceeds via a Manager, whose (!nolink [AES]) ID for the message exchange has to
be ascertained. The recipe for this runs as follows:

ú (!B)1: The application requires OLE (i.e. OEP and OLGA)(!b)
!begin_xlist [(a)]
!label OLEMANGR

!item [(a)] If appl_find("OLEMANGR") is successful the Manager has already
      been located.

!label Environmnetal variable OLEMANAGER
!label OLEMANAGER, Environmnetal variable

!item [(b)]
      Otherwise the environmnetal variable OLEMANAGER is evaluated.
      This can contain a complete access path! First of all the
      program name for appl_find is extracted and then proceeds as
      for (a). If the name cannot be ascertained the program indicated
      by OLEMANAGER is launched using shel_write.

!label OEP_SERV

!item [(c)]
      If the above has not been successful, there is obviously no
      OLE-Manager and one may have to make do with the OLGA protocol.
      To do this (similar to (a)) an appl_find("OLGA ") (!I)as well as(!i)
      appl_find("OEP_SERV") is performed and two Managers must now be
      supported!

!label Environmnetal variable OLGAMANAGER
!label OLGAMANAGER, Environmnetal variable
!label Environmnetal variable OEPSERVER
!label OEPSERVER, Environmnetal variable

!item [(d)]
				If all else fails the environmental variables OLGAMANAGER
          and OEPSERVER, as under (b) are evaluated.

!end_xlist

ù (!B)2: The application only requires OLGA(!b)
!begin_quote
     The process proceeds as for (1), except the sequence is altered
     to (c), (d), (a) and (b). However, OEP_SERV and OEPSERVER are not
     evaluated because it's unlikely an OEP-Server will understand the
     OLGA-Protocol.

!begin_node OLGA-Client

An OLGA-Client is an application capable of editing objects used in
other applications. Note that applications can be both Client and
Server simultaneously; this doesn't cause problems and is highly
desireable in most cases.

The following messages can be sent to or received from an OLGA-Client:

!begin_xlist [ù OLGA_SERVERTERMINATED ] !short
!item [ù OLGA_CLOSEDOC] Indicates closing of a document
!item [ù OLGA_GETINFO] Obtains index number for an Info file
!item [ù OLGA_LINK] Indicates inclusion of a file in a document
!item [ù OLGA_LINKBROKEN] Reference to an object is no longer available
!item [ù OLGA_LINKRENAMED]    Reference to an object has been updated
!item [ù OLGA_OPENDOC]        Registers document with Manager
!item [ù OLGA_RENAMELINK]     Updates reference to an object
!item [ù OLGA_START]          Launches Server for a Client in parallel
!item [ù OLGA_UPDATED]        Server has altered a file
!item [ù OLGA_UNLINK]         Terminates monitoring of a file
!item [ù OLGA_SERVERTERMINATED]   Server has terminated
!end_xlist

(!B)Warning:(!b) One has to point out here that in view of future operating
system versions, memory regions used for communication between various
programs or assigned via pointers have to be (!nolink [global]) (Mxalloc function
with Global flag set). Otherwise, memory protection violation would
occur if used on computers with (!nolink [PMMU])s (e.g. Atari-TT030 or Falcon030).

!begin_node OLGA-Server

An OLGA-Server is an application capable of creating and editing
objects. Note that applications can be both (!link [Client][OLGA-Client]) and Server at the
same time; this doesn't cause problems and is highly desireable in
most cases.

The following messages can be sent to or received from an OLGA-Server:

!end_xlist

(!B)Warning:(!b) One has to point out here that in view of future operating

              it sends this message after the 'Save as...' (!nolink [command]).
              It would be sensible in any case if the Server adopts
              the new path specification, or new filename, for the
              the document. Though links should exist only for files
              on (!I)non-(!i)interchangeable media, in practice this may be
              difficult or impossible to achieve. If the contents of
              the file has changed, then additionally the message
              OLGA_UPDATE has to be sent.

              The Server subsequently receives a (!link [reply][OLGA_RENAME, Response to]), to which it
              can react for instance by releasing the old memory area.
              Incidentally, the confirmation only means that the
              Manager has passed on the renaming; if the Client does
              not react to this, then the corresponding link is dead,
              i.e. it can no longer be supervised!

!begin_node InplaceDrawing for OLGA (ID-4)
This function is one of a set added to OLGA in Rev 1.2 (1996-11-20).

For InplaceDrawing ('ID4-OLGA', 'ID4') to function, the OLGA-Manager
must be correctly installed and OLGA.INF must be properly structured
(containing the [(!nolink [Extensions])] and [Objects] sections). ID4-Server and
-Clients are entirely normal OLGA-Server and OLGA-Clients, which
additionally support the ID4-Client and ID4-Server protocols.

!begin_node ID4-Client
!label User selection
ID4-Clients embed objects in its documents (which is why these Clients
are also called 'Container applications'). A Client uses the function
OLGA_GETOBJECTS to ascertain all the ID4-objects in OLGA.INF which
could, for example, display the following dialog:

!ifdest [html]
!ifset [No_Bilder_Pfad]
!image olga_2
!else
!image (!picture_path)\olga_2
!endif
!else
!image (!picture_path)\olga_2
!endif
For each object that is to be embedded, an ID4-Client must put the
following structure in global memory (see also OLGA.H and OLGA.INC):
!label OLGAObjectInfo
!begin_verbatim
typedef struct ObjectInfo
{
 char  *Filename;
 AESPB *ClientGEMPB;
 long   ClientData,
 ServerData;
 int    CBLock,
        CBCount;
 void   cdecl (*CBDraw)    (ObjectInfo *objectinfo,
                           int outScreen,
                           int outHandle,
                           int outDevID,
                           GRECT *Size,
                           GRECT *Clip);
 void   cdecl (*CBUnembed) (ObjectInfo *objectinfo);
} OLGAObjectInfo;

!end_verbatim

Afterwards the required ID4-Servers can be started in parallel using
OLGA_ACTIVATE and all objects will be included individually with
OLGA_EMBED.

!label CBLock
To draw an object, a Client proceeds as follows: First of all
OLGAObjectInfo.CBLock of the corresponding object is increased by one.
Immediately afterwards the Client tests whether CBLock contains a
value higher than NULL. If this is not the case the Client must not
call the Callback routines! Otherwise the Client tests whether CBDraw
is not NULL - if yes it calls the Callback routine. Finally CBLock is
again decremented (reduced by one).

On receipt of OLGA_INPLACEUPDATE, Clients should re-draw the object
contained (or passed) in this message.

On deletion of an object (or closing of a document i.e. termination of
the Client) CBUnembed must be called for every object, so long as the
Callback is not NULL. The safeguards with CBLock described above
apply. The Server then knows that for this object no more ID4-linking
exists (or is one less).

Conversely a Server sends the Client OLGA_UNEMBED if it can no longer
provide (or there is drawn) an embedded object. The Client can then
mark the object 'invalid' (for example it could display a white
rectangle crossed out in red). A Client should react similarly on
receipt of an OLGA_SERVERTERMINATED message.

This function was added to OLGA in Rev 1.2 (1996-11-20).

!begin_node OLGA_GETOBJECTS
An ID4-Client can use this message to ask the Manager which filetypes
can be embedded via ID4-OLGA.

!hline

               WORD 6  !!   0
               WORD 7  !!   0
!end_table

In reply the Client receives the OLGA_OBJECTS message, including
the extension and plain text description of the filetype for the
User selection.

The Manager replies to the (!nolink [ID4-Client]) with an OLGA_OBJECTS message
as follows:

!label OLGA_OBJECTS
!begin_table  [l|l]
               Parameter !! Meaning
!hline
               WORD 0    !! (!nolink [Message]) number (0x1243)

               WORD 3    !! Number of objects which can still be
                         !! retrieved (0 means this is the last object)
               WORD 4+5  !! Extension of the file format, e.g. '.(!nolink [GEM])'

               ~         !! (valid until the Manager is terminated)
!end_table

The message OLGA_GETOBJECTS must now be sent to the Manager until the
OLGA_OBJECTS WORD 3 returns NULL.

This function was added to OLGA in Rev 1.2 (1996-11-20).

!begin_node OLGA_ACTIVATE

Sometime before drawing, ideally before embedding the first object,
and outside (!) a wind_update blocking, the ID4-Client should send
the Manager the following message. If the Client, before the next
wind_update, does not enter its event loop, it must perform an
event_timer of at least 1000ms after it.

The Client sends to the Manager:

!begin_table  [l|l]
               Parameter !! Meaning

               WORD 0   !!  (!nolink [Message]) number (0x124a)

               WORD 7   !!  0
!end_table

In this message all different extensions of all embedded objects
should be passed so the Manager can then start a suitable Server. As
confirmation the Manager sends the following message:

!label OLGA_ACK

               WORD 4+5 !!  Pointer to OLGAObjectInfo of the object
               WORD 6+7 !!  Extension
!end_table

The Client flag can be freely set from the Client and will later be
returned to the Client. The (!link [extension][Extensions]) describes the filetype of the
filenames from OLGAObjectInfo (e.g. '.(!nolink [GEM])'). This extension is used
to communicate with the ID4-Server - which must already be running in
parallel (see OLGA_ACTIVATE).

The actual embeding may be carried out by the Client only when it has
received the following OLGA_EMBEDDED message direct from the Server:

!begin_table  [l|l]
               Parameter !! Meaning
!hline
               WORD 0  !!   (!nolink [Message]) number (0x124c)
               WORD 1  !!   serverID
               WORD 2  !!   0
               WORD 3  !!   Client-flag
               WORD 4+5 !!  Pointer to OLGAObjectInfo
               WORD 6   !!  Width of the object in 1/100mm (unsigned),
                    ~   !!  0 on error
               WORD 7   !!  Height of the object in 1/100mm (unsigned),
                    ~   !!  0 on error
!end_table

Client-flag and OLGAObjectInfo pointer are unchanged to OLGA_EMBED.
The ServerData may have been changed by the Server (as the name
indicates, this field belongs to the Server and may not be changed
by the Client), and in CBDraw the Server should enter a pointer to
its drawing routine.

With WORD 6/WORD 7 the Server informs the Client of the optimum object
size. The client need not maintain this size, but in any case it knows
the aspect ratio (proportions) of the object from the width/height
ratio.

(!B)Important:(!b) If WORD 6/WORD 7 are NULL, an error has been encountered
(in this case the Manager may already have sent out an OLGA_EMBEDDED
message). The Client may then not embed the object!

This function was added to OLGA in Rev 1.2 (1996-11-20).

!end_node


!begin_node ID4-Server

(!B)Important:(!b) If ID4 is to function with memory protection the GLOBAL-
flag should be set in the ID4-Server program header!

If a Client would like to embed an object, the Server will receive
an OLGA_EMBED message from the Manager, to which it must reply with
OLGA_EMBEDDED.

To draw, the Client calls CBDraw-Callback. During processing of the
Callback the Server as a rule may not make any (!nolink [AES]) calls (it closes
wind_update!). The Server must also not adjust the palette. If the
Server makes changes to an object, it can immediately send an
OLGA_INPLACEUPDATE message to the Client so that it can perform an
immediate update.

To avoid passing an undefined pointer on terminating a Server or
closing of documents, the Server must proceed as follows:

For each object, the Server tests whether OLGAObjectInfo.CBLock<=0.
If this is the case, the Server first sets CBLock to -16000, then
CBDraw to NULL.

Everything must be enclosed in an evnt_timer loop and repeated until
no more objects are assigned. Only then may the Server terminate or
close the document window.

Once the Server has set all corresponding CBDraw pointers to NULL, an
OLGA_UNEMBED message must be sent to the Client. On receipt of this
message the Client can mark the objects as 'invalid', for example by
drawing a white rectangle crossed out by a red cross.

In order for a Server to determine if a Client is still using an
embedded object, the Clients will call CBUNEMBED Callback to
dissolve the connection. An ID4-Server should react the same way on
receipt of OLGA_CLIENTTERMINATED.

In order to avoid any problems resulting from a Server crash, the
Server should overwrite etv_critic, and by running this routine
CBDraw will set all objects to NULL and CBLock to -16000.

This function was added to OLGA in Rev 1.2 (1996-11-20).

!end_node


!begin_node OLGA_EMBEDDED

If a Client would like to embed an object, the Server receives the
following OLGA_EMBED message from the Manager:

!begin_table  [l|l]
               Parameter !! Meaning
!hline
               WORD 0   !!  (!nolink [Message]) number (0x124b)
               WORD 1   !!  Manager identifier (manID)

               WORD 3   !!  Client-flag
               WORD 4+5 !!  Pointer to OLGAObjectInfo
               WORD 6   !!  0
               WORD 7   !!  ClientID
!end_table

!label ServerData
WORDs 3..5 may not be changed by the Server and must be returned by
OLGA_EMBEDDED. The ServerData field in OLGAObjectInfo can be freely
used by the Server.

The Server can now load the file passed in OLGAObjectInfo, set CBLock
to NULL and enter in CBDraw the pointer to its draw routine. In
CBUnembed, the Server can carry a routine which the Client will call
on dissolving the ID4-connection.

The Server must then immediately (!) send the Client the following
OLGA_EMBEDDED reply (the Server obtains the ClientID from WORD 7 of
the above (!nolink [OLGA_EMBED]) message):


!begin_table  [l|l]
               Parameter !! Meaning
!hline
               WORD 0  !!   (!nolink [Message]) number (0x124c)
               WORD 1  !!   Server identifier (serverID)
               WORD 2  !!   0
               WORD 3  !!   Client-flag
               WORD 4+5 !!   Pointer to OLGAObjectInfo
               WORD 6   !!  Width of the object in 1/100mm (unsigned),
                    ~   !!  0 on error
               WORD 7   !!  Height of the object in 1/100mm (unsigned),
                     ~  !!  0 on error
!end_table

If the Server indicates an error in WORD 6..7, the Client will not
embed the object.

(!B)Important:(!b) If the Server was started in parallel with the Manager,
OLGA_EMBED messages can arrive before the Server has ended its OLGA
installation! It is up to the Server whether it deals with the
OLGA_EMBEDDED replies immediately or only after completing its
initialization.

This function was added to OLGA in Rev 1.2 (1996-11-20).

!end_node


!begin_node OLGA_UNEMBED

In order to avoid undefined pointers when terminating a Server or
closing a document, the Server must proceed as follows:

For every object the Server checks whether CBLock<=0. If this is the
case then the Server first of all sets CBLock to -16000, then CBDraw to NULL.

Everything must be enclosed in an evnt_timer loop and repeated until
no more objects are assigned. After this the Server may terminate or
close the document window.

Once the Server has set all corresponding CBDraw pointers to NULL
etc. it must send the Client directly (!) for each object the
following message (or a single message instead with WORD 3..4=NULL
on terminating):

!begin_table  [l|l]
               Parameter !! Meaning
!hline
               WORD 0  !!   (!nolink [Message]) number (0x124d)
               WORD 1  !!   Server identifier (serverID)
               WORD 2  !!   0
               WORD 3  !!   0
               WORD 4+5 !!  Pointer to OLGAObjectInfo, or NULL
                     ~  !!  (see above)
               WORD 6   !!  0
               WORD 7   !!  0
!end_table

On receipt of this message the Client can mark the objects as
'invalid' (for example it could display a white rectangle crossed
out in red).

This function was added to OLGA in Rev 1.2 (1996-11-20).

!begin_node OLGA_INPLACEUPDATE

If changes are made to a document, the Server can send the Client
the following message, so the last embedded object can be immediately
redrawn (without requiring a Save). The Server may only send this
message after it has sent OLGA_EMBEDDED to the Client!

!begin_table  [l|l]

                          outScreen,
                          outHandle,

                          Clip: GRECTPtr);
!end_verbatim
If CBDraw is called by the Client, the Server should check whether
the file OLGAObjectInfo.Filename (the OLGAObjectInfo pointer is passed
by CBDraw) is already loaded - if not then it should do so now.
Since the loading should actually have been ensured through
OLGA_EMBED, one can in that case alternatively signal an error, for
example by crossing out the object area using two red lines (or
possibly by displaying the actual error as plain text in the object
area).

Then the Server can draw the graphics with the help of the passed
values (see below). Inside of this drawing routine the Server must
not make any wind_update calls! The CBDraw parameters have the
following meaning:
!begin_itemize
!label outScreen
   !item outScreen signals whether output is to be to the screen (<>0) or
     not (=0). An on-screen preview is screen output too!

!label outHandle
!item outHandle is the handle of the open workstation (screen, printer
     etc.), to which the Server can output directly. If outScreen is
     <>0, the Server can also alternatively output to its own screen
     workstation.

!label outDevID
!item outDevID gives the device number (from ASSIGN.SYS) of the driver
     to output to. If outputting purely to screen this field contains
     NULL. Although a preview is an output to the screen, outDevID in
     that case specifies, for instance, the driver to which output
     will be made later during printing. In that case the Server can
     try to open that driver in order to better match the screen
     output to subsequent printer output.

!label Size
!label Clip
!item Size is the rectangle in which the passed graphic must fit
     exactly, even if this leads to distortions. Clip is the Clipping
     rectangle (set before the call).
!end_itemize
(!B)Important:(!b) A Server must not make any (!nolink [AES]) calls during CBDraw!
(Unless the AESPB pointer field has been adapted by the ClientGEMPB;
nevertheless wind_update remains taboo for ID4-Servers).
Additionally the colour palette in Callback must not be changed.

This function was added to OLGA in Rev 1.2 (1996-11-20).

On deletion of an object (or closing of a document i.e. termination),

those of a specified filetype.

As always the (!link [extensions][Extensions]) in the following messages must always be in
