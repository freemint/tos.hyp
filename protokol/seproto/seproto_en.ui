!begin_node SE protocol
The purpose of the SE protocol is the communication between program
development shells and editors, hence the name: (!B)S(!b)hell-(!B)E(!b)ditor protocol.

This protocol serves, under multitasking systems, to cause the shell
to perform compilation and similar actions from within the editor, and
to return shell error-messages and/or error files to the editor.

Commands or messages from the shell to the editor start with SE_,
messages from the editor to the shell start with ES_.

The current version number of the protocol is 1.05.

# ========================================================================
!begin_node Contact initiation
Initiating contact proceeds as follows:

After startup, the shell sends the message SE_INIT. As a reply it will
then receive the message ES_OK. From the bit-fields of both messages
the shell can now deduce which commands it can send to the editor and
which commands are to be expected from the editor. If the shell no
longer wishes to participate in the SE protocol (for instance because
it is being terminated) then it will send the message SE_QUIT to the
editor.

After launching, the editor sends the message ES_INIT. As a reply it
will then receive the message SE_OK. From the bit-fields of both
messages the editor can now deduce which commands it can send to the
shell and which commands are to be expected from the shell. If the
editor no longer wishes to participate in the SE protocol (for
instance because it is being terminated) then it will send the message
ES_QUIT to the editor.

The remaining question is to whom the shell and editor should send
these messages. The SE protocol is best suited for use under a
multitasking system, in which the (!nolink [AES]) function appl_search will
normally be available. So the shell and editor should simply send
their respective init message to all processes (except the system
processes).

Other possibilities:
!begin_itemize
 !item If the shell knows the name of the editor, it can, of course,
     restrict itself to this and send SE_INIT only to it.

!index XAcc protocol
 !item If the function appl_search is not available, then the (!nolink [XAcc])
     protocol provides an alternative for initiating contact: Shell
     and editor should simply send their init messages to every
     process that registers itself via XAcc. The XAcc protocol also
     provides for a machine-readable identification of the program
     type (XDSC), so that one may be able to recognize whether the
     communication partner one is dealing with is a shell (ID `PE' for
     "Programming Environment") or whether it is an editor (ID `ED'
     for "text EDitor").
!end_itemize

# ========================================================================
!begin_node Notes on SE protocol

When we talk of a 'message' in the following, then this means an (!nolink [AES])
message that consists of 8 WORDs (integers) and is sent with the (!nolink [AES])
function appl_write. The first WORD always contains the number of
the message, the second the application ID of the sender and the third
is always NULL. The allocation of the other WORDs depends on the
particular message in each case. WORDs for which no allocation is
specified are to be set to NULL.

(!B)Please note:(!b) As the count starts from 0, then 'WORD 3' in the
following means the (!I)fourth(!i) WORD!

For clarification, once again in C:
!begin_quote
!begin_verbatim
 int msg[8];

 msg[0] = SE_ACK;   /* Message                          */
 msg[1] = gl_apid;  /* ID of the sender                 */
 msg[2] = 0;        /* 0, i.e. no excess length         */
 msg[3] = TRUE;     /* This is "WORD 3"                 */
 msg[4] = msg[5] = msg[6] = msg[7] = 0; /* Rest to NULL */
 appl_write (editor, 16, msg);          /* Send         */
!end_verbatim
!end_quote

!smallskip

!index Pointer
If a pointer (i.e. an address) is contained in a message, then the
upper WORD of the address is passed in the first and the lower WORD
in the second of the specified WORDs.

With pointers to memory areas, each sender of the message must ensure
that these memory areas can also be read by the receiver (memory
protection!). For this they have to be allocated as 'readable'! This
is achieved via the Gemdos call Mxalloc.

!index Line numbers
With some messages it is possible to pass line and column numbers for
the cursor position. As there are different opinions whether lines
and/or columns should be counted starting from zero or from one, it is
recommended that these statements should be checked before adoption
and corrected if necessary. So if the editor starts counting its lines
from one then a line number of zero should not upset it and it should
be handled as line one.

As a reply the shell receives an ES_ACK.

!smallskip

(!B)Note:(!b) The specification of line and column numbers is only provided
for from protocol Version 1.02 onwards. Programs that still use older
protocol versions should really have set the WORDs 5..7 to NULL. If
one wants to be quite certain, then it may be necessary to enquire
the version number of the shell passed by SE_INIT or SE_OK.

If the shell can't or doesn't want to make any position specification,
it should set the line and column to zero.

!end_node

# ========================================================================
!begin_node SE_PROJECT
!raw [stg] @xref ES_ACK
The shell tells the editor that the project has been altered. The
filename of the current project file will be passed as a parameter.
If NULL is passed, the current project should be logged off.

A sensible reaction of the editor in this case would be to also change
the project, insofar as it supports this.

!smallskip

(!U)Reply:(!u)

The editor acknowledges with ES_ACK.

!smallskip

(!B)Note:(!b) Setting the name of the project file to NULL is available only
from protocol Version 1.01 onwards. The shell should therefore check
beforehand whether the editor understands protocol Version 1.01 or
higher.

!end_node

# ========================================================================
!begin_node SE_QUIT
The shell tells the editor that is is being terminated. The editor in
this case should forget the shell as a communications partner.

(!U)Reply:(!u)

No reply is expected!

!end_node

# ========================================================================
!begin_node SE_TERMINATE
!raw [stg] @xref ES_ACK
The shell tells the editor that it should terminate itself. The editor
should terminate itself in this case and run through its normal
termination process (and during this also send an ES_QUIT). The reason
for such a message from the shell could be insufficient memory for
compilation, for instance.

!smallskip

# ========================================================================
!begin_node SE_CLOSE
!raw [stg] @xref ES_ACK
The shell tells the editor that it is to save or close given texts.
When closing altered texts the editor should first issue a
confirmation query.

!smallskip

(!U)Make-up of the message:(!u)
!begin_xlist [Word 4+5:~]
 !item [Word 3+4]: A pointer to the name of a file, or a file mask.
             '*.*' represents all text windows (so corresponds to
             the SE_CLOSE of the protocol Version 1.00).
 !item [Word 5]:   0 = Save only (!nl)
                   1 = Save and close (!nl)
                   2 = Close without saving (from version 1.04 on)
!end_xlist

!smallskip

(!U)Reply:(!u)

The editor confirms the message with ES_ACK.

!smallskip

(!B)Note:(!b) In the protocol Version 1.00 no provision was made for
parameters for SE_CLOSE. Editors that only support Version 1.00 will
therefore ingnore the file masks and the flag and save all texts.

!end_node

# ========================================================================
!begin_node SE_MENU
!raw [stg] @xref ES_ACK
The shell tells the editor what it should enter for individual
programs in its menu. This way the editor can use the same texts as
the shell for those menu entries that trigger an action in the shell.


!smallskip

(!U)Make-up of the message:(!u)
!begin_xlist [Word 4+5:~]
 !item [Word 3+4]: A pointer to an info structure, which is built

!end_xlist

!label SEMENUINFO
!begin_verbatim
  typedef struct
  {
    char *compStr;      /* Text for the menu entry "Compiler"       */
    char *makeStr;      /* Text for the menu entry "Makefile"       */
    char *makeAllStr;   /* Text for the menu entry "Make all"       */
    char *linkStr;      /* Text for the menu entry "Linker"         */
    char *execStr;      /* Text for the menu entry "Execute"        */
    char *makeExecStr;  /* Text for the menu entry "Make & Execute" */
    char *progName;     /* Name of the shell (from version 1.04 on) */
    char *shellCtrlStr; /* Text for the menu entry "Shell Control"  */
                        /* (from version 1.05 on)                   */
  } SEMENUINFO;
!end_verbatim

!smallskip

(!U)Reply:(!u)

The editor confirms the message with ES_ACK.

!smallskip

(!B)Note:(!b) The texts are all optional and can also be NULL if the shell
has no corresponding menu entry. This does not mean, however, that the
shell does not offer this functionality. Therefore the editor should
insert defaults for all texts if necessary.

This message exists only from protocol Version 1.02 onwards. But a
test if the corresponding bit in ES_INIT or ES_OK is set is
sufficient.

When accessing (!I)progName(!i) and (!I)shellCtrlStr(!i) one has to ensure that the
communications partner also supports these already (test the protocol
version)!

             An ES_ACK with TRUE says nothing about whether the
             command was executed successfully. It only says that
             the editor understands the command and will execute it!
!end_xlist

(!U)Reply:(!u)

None (ES_ACK is already a reply to a message).

!end_node

# ========================================================================
!begin_node ES_COMPILE
!raw [stg] @xref SE_ACK
The editor tells the shell that it should translate a file. A pointer
to the filename can be passed in the message.

This message must be confirmed with SE_ACK.

!smallskip

(!B)Note:(!b) Provision for setting the name of the file to be compiled to
NULL is available only in protocol versions from 1.03 on. The editor
should therefore check beforehand that the shell supports at least
protocol Version 1.03.

!end_node

# ========================================================================
!begin_node ES_MAKE
!raw [stg] @xref SE_ACK
The editor tells the shell that it should perform a 'make'.
A filename can be passed in the message, but does not have to be set
and also does not have to be paid regard to by the shell!

!smallskip

(!U)Make-up of the message:(!u)
!begin_xlist [Word 4+5:~]
 !item [Word 3+4]: Pointer to the mame of the makefile, or NULL

!end_node
# ========================================================================
!begin_node ES_MAKEALL

The shell confirms the message with SE_ACK.

!end_node

# ========================================================================
!begin_node ES_LINK
!raw [stg] @xref SE_ACK
The editor tells the shell that a program is to be linked.
A filename can be passed in the message, but does not necessarily
have to be paid regard to by the shell!

!smallskip

(!U)Make-up of the message:(!u)
!begin_xlist [Word 4+5:~]
 !item [Word 3+4]: Pointer to the name of the source that is to be 
                   linked or NULL

(!U)Reply:(!u)

The shell confirms the message with SE_ACK.

!end_node

# ========================================================================
!begin_node ES_EXEC
!raw [stg] @xref SE_ACK
The editor tells the shell that the program for the source is to be
executed. A filename can be passed, but does not have to be paid
regard to by the shell.

!smallskip

(!U)Make-up of the message:(!u)
!begin_xlist [Word 4+5:~]
 !item [Word 3+4]: Pointer to the name of the file to be executed
                   or NULL

                   For a source file it may be necessay to compile 
                   and/or link it first

(!U)Reply:(!u)

The shell confirms the message with SE_ACK.

!end_node
# ========================================================================
!begin_node ES_MAKEEXEC

The shell should perform a 'make' and execute the program afterwards.
A filename for the makefile can (but does not have to be) passed in
the message.

(!U)Reply:(!u)

The shell confirms the message with SE_ACK.

!end_node

#=====================================================================
!begin_node ES_PROJECT
!raw [stg] @xref SE_ACK
The editor tells the shell that the project has been altered/changed.
The filename of the project file will be passed as a parameter in the
message. If NULL is passed, then the current project should be logged
off.

A sensible reaction of the shell in this case would be to also change
the project, as long as it supports this.

!smallskip

(!U)Make-up of the message:(!u)
!begin_xlist [Word 4+5:~]
 !item [Word 3+4]: Pointer to the name of the projectfile or NULL
!end_xlist

!smallskip

(!U)Reply:(!u)

The shell confirms the message with SE_ACK.

!smallskip

(!B)Note:(!b) Provision for setting the name of the projectfile to NULL is
only available in protocol versions from 1.01 on. The editor should
therefore check beforehand that the shell supports at least protocol
Version 1.01.

!end_node
# ========================================================================
!begin_node ES_QUIT
The editor tells the shell that it is now being terminated. The shell
should forget about the editor as a communications partner in that case.

!begin_description
 !item [No parameters]
!end_description

(!U)Reply:(!u)

No reply is expected!

!begin_node Authors and programs
The SE protocol was developed by Dirk Steins and Frank Storm, 
while the extensions to the newer protocol versions originate from 
Christian Felsch and Dirk Haun.

The number of programs that support the SE protocol is unfortunately
not very large as yet:
!begin_itemize
 !item Editors:
  !begin_itemize
   !item (!I)Clix(!i) by Steffen Engels
   !item (!I)Everest(!i) by Oliver Schmidt (from version 3.5 on)
   !item (!I)Fred(!i) by Dirk Steins
   !item (!I)qed(!i) by Christian Felsch (from version 3.3 on, in addition from 
         version 3.70 the protocol version 1.01 is supported as well)
  !end_itemize
 !item Shells:
  !begin_itemize
   !item (!I)Chatwin(!i) by Dirk Haun (from version 3.04 the SE protocol is 
         supported completely, older versios support only the most 
         important messages)
   !item (!I)Shell for Megamax Modula-2(!i) by Thomas Tempelmann and Dirk 
         Steins
   !item (!I)PC-Shell(!i) by Frank Schramm (from version 3.01 on)
  !end_itemize
 !item Miscellaneous:
  !begin_itemize
   !item (!I)SE-Lib(!i) by Manfred Rosenboom and Dirk Haun
   
         This library is accompanied also by SE-Evaluator, a kind of 
         debugger for the SE protocol.
  !end_itemize
!end_itemize

It is to be hoped that further editors and shells will support this
useful protocol in the future. We hope that this text will help its
wider distribution and adoption.
