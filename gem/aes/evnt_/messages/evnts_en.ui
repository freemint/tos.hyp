!begin_node Messages
!label AES messages

(!B)Standard messages of the (!link [screen-manager][The screen-manager]) are
built up as follows:(!b)

!begin_xlist [msg___]
!item [msg[0!]]
Message type
!item [msg[1!]]
Application ID of sender
!item [msg[2!]]
Length of additional data; if non-zero, use appl_read to read the additional
data. Always 0 in messages sent by the (!nolink [AES]).
!end_xlist

(!B)Types of standard messages:(!b)

!begin_xlist [RESCH_COMPLETED (61)]
!item [Message]
Meaning
!item [~]
~

!label AC_CLOSE
!item [AC_CLOSE (41)]
This is sent to a desk accessory when the current application terminates, the
screen is cleared and the window manager is reinitialized
!begin_xlist !compressed
!item [msg[3!]]
Identifier of the desk accessory
!end_xlist
(!B)Note:(!b) This message plays practically no role in multitasking systems
any more, and is also no longer present in MagiC!

!label AC_OPEN
!item [AC_OPEN (40)]
A desk accessory has been activated
!begin_xlist !compressed
!item [msg[4!]]
Identifier of the desk accessory; (!nl)
PC-(!nolink [GEM]) returns this information in msg[3]!, while KAOS 1.4.2 sets
both entries
!end_xlist

Geneva has the following extension: (!nl)
If an application sends an AC_OPEN message to another application, it can
optionally set WORD 4 of the message to -1; in this case, Geneva will
automatically substitute the correct menu identifier for the application in
WORD 4. (!I)Example to open application with ID #5:(!i)

int buf[8]im { AC_OPEN, 5, 0, my_apid, -1 }; (!nl)
appl_write( 5, 16, buf );

Sending an AC_OPEN message to a desk accessory will cause it to open if it is
not already open, or it will make its window topmost (by sending a WM_TOPPED
message) if the desk accessory has a window open; an application will receive
a WM_TOPPED message, if it has a window open.

!label AP_DRAGDROP
!item [AP_DRAGDROP (63)]
This is a part of the Drag&Drop protocol and is sent by the sender to the
receiver
!begin_xlist !compressed
!item [msg[3!]]
ID (handle) of the destination window
!item [msg[4!]]
X-position of the mouse pointer
!item [msg[5!]]
Y-position of the mouse pointer
!item [msg[6!]]
Keyboard Shift status
!item [msg[7!]]
2-byte ASCII packed pipe identifier
!end_xlist
(!B)Note:(!b) If a value of -1 is passed instead of a valid window ID, then the
destination of the Drag&Drop operation is no specific window, but the application
itself; in that case normally one should open an additional window for the
specified data.

!label AP_RESCHG
!item [AP_RESCHG (57)]
With this message, which is a sub-command only found as a possible value in
AP_TERM (50), the relevant application is informed that a resolution change is
to take place; the receiver of this message should then terminate itself as
soon as possible

!label AP_TERM
!item [AP_TERM (50)]
The operating system requests the application to terminate itself; this may be
necessary for a (!link [resolution change][Resolution change]), for instance, or
triggered by a general Shutdown utility
!begin_xlist !compressed
!item [msg[5!]]
Reason for the shutdown, so e.g.
!begin_xlist [AP_RESCHG] !compressed
!item [AP_TERM]
(General termination)
!item [AP_RESCHG]
((!nolink [Resolution change]))
!end_xlist
!end_xlist
(!B)Warning:(!b) Contrary to the usual convention, the value -1 (!I)must(!i) be
entered in msg[1], as according to MagiC documentation one can not
guarantee otherwise that the desktop will react to an
[Alternate]-[Control]-[Delete] Shutdown sequence

(!B)Note:(!b) Desk accesories will always be sent AC_CLOSE messages, not AP_TERM

!label AP_TFAIL
!item [AP_TFAIL (51)]
This is sent by the receiver of an AC_CLOSE or AP_TERM message if this does
(!I)not wish to(!i) or (!I)cannot(!i) terminate itself

!item [msg[3!]]
High byte: Scancode of the pressed key
(!nl)
Low byte : ASCII-code of the key
!end_xlist

!label FNT_CHANGED
!item [FNT_CHANGED (83)]
This is sent if GDOS fonts were loaded or unloaded at run-time.
(!nl)
At the receipt of this message the reaction should be vst_unload_fonts, followed
directly by vst_load_fonts; this ensures that the application can work with the
current fonts

!label MN_SELECTED
!item [MN_SELECTED (10)]
This is sent when a menu option is chosen
!begin_xlist !compressed
!item [msg[3!]]
The object index of the menu title selected

!end_xlist

One should proceed as follows: (!nl)
If [5] >=0, then we are dealing with a normal scroll message (!nl)
If [5] < 0, then one negates the value and obtains the factor for [4] (!nl)
If [7] < 0, then one negates the value and obtains the factor for [6] (!nl)
Otherwise [6] will be ignored

(!B)Example:(!b)  (!nl)
If one receives [WM_ARROWED 1 0 win WA_DNLINE -2 WA_RTLINE -1] for instance,
then one should scroll two lines downwards and one column to the right

The application receives this message when operating the backdrop button of
the window. This message is present only in KAOS 1.4.2 as well as MagiC 1 and
2; since MagiC Version 3, WM_BOTTOMED is sent.

!label WM_BOTTOMED
!item [WM_BOTTOMED (33)]
This is used by the (!link [screen-manager][The screen-manager]) to request
that the application should place a window in the background. In some
(!nolink [TOS]) versions this is triggered by [Shift]-clicking on the window's

This is used by the (!link [screen-manager][The screen-manager]) to request
that the application should place a window in the background (say when the
'(!link [Backdrop][The components of a window])' button is activated). As of
MagiC 3 this opcode is no longer sent, but WM_BOTTOMED is used instead.
!begin_xlist !compressed

changed again; the message is sent only when the application has not itself
issued a call to place the window in the foreground

Messages of this type are coalesced in the (!nolink [AES]) message buffer. It
follows from this that at all times the last message of this type will be
received; thus there cannot be several of these messages in the buffer.

!item [WM_UNICONIFY (35)]
This message is sent when the user double-clicks one or more iconified windows
of an application to uniconify it/them; if several windows are affected
(WM_ALLICONIFY) then it is up to the application alone to process this,
as the (!nolink [AES]) does not make available any information about the windows
in question, including their positions or dimensions

!end_xlist

Support of the newer message types can be inquired with
(!link [appl_getinfo][%apgi_12]) (opcode 12). Incidentally, for user-defined
messages (!I)Digital Research(!i) has suggested message numbers beyond 1024.

About the size of the message buffer:

An individual application should not use more than 16 windows under MagiC 2.0,
as otherwise the message buffer of the system can overflow and possibly
redraws can no longer be performed.
