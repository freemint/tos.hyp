(!begin_liste) [Availability]

!item [Name:]
ØShell writeÆ - Launch another application.

!item [Opcode:]
121

!item [Syntax:]
int16_t shel_write ( int16_t sh_wdoex, int16_t sh_wisgr, int16_t sh_wiscr,
                  int8_t *sh_wpcmd, int8_t *sh_wptail );

!item [Description:]
The call shel_write permits launching another program. As of (!nolink [AES])
version 4.0 this function was expanded greatly, so now one can also perform
tasks such as the Shutdown of the system, changing screen resolution,
(!nolink [AES]) broadcasting and a number of other functions.

The parameter (!I)sh_wdoex(!i) determines the action to be performed, the
remaining parameters depend in essence on (!I)sh_wdoex.(!i) The following
apply:

!begin_xlist !short [sh_wdoe]
!item [(!I)sh_wdoex(!i)]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [0]
(!B)Launch application(!b)
(!nl)
The value of the parameter (!I)sh_wisgr(!i) (launch in graphic mode, yes/no) is
set automatically by the (!nolink [AES]), by comparing the file extension with
the contents of (!nolink [AES]) environmental variables GEMEXT, TOSEXT and ACCEXT
!item [1]
(!B)Launch application im (!nolink [GEM/TOS]) mode(!b)
(!nl)
The parameter (!I)sh_wisgr(!i) sets the mode in which the program is to be
launched; the following apply:
!begin_xlist !short [sh_wisgr = 0:]
!item [sh_wisgr = 0:]
Launch as (!nolink [TOS]) program
!item [sh_wisgr = 1:]
Launch as (!nolink [GEM]) program
!end_xlist
!item [2]
(!B)Reserved(!b)
!item [3]
(!B)Start accessory(!b)
(!nl)
A program is to be launched as a desk accessory
!end_xlist

In the parameters (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) and (!I)sh_wptail(!i) one should pass the
filename of the program to be launched and a pointer to the command line tail
respectively. The default directory will be chosen as the directory that
contains the program to be launched (Exception: extended mode with bit 10 set -
see below).

The function returns the (!nolink [AES]) ID of the launched process. A value of
0 in this connection denotes that an error has occurred. With the parameter
(!I)sh_wiscr(!i) one can specify whether (!B)parameters via ARGV(!b) should be
passed to the launched program. The following apply:

sh_wiscr = 0: Do not use ARGV procedure (!nl)
sh_wiscr = 1: Use (!nolink [ARGV procedure])

!label Parallel launching of programs
Under MagiC, on the other hand, one can specify whether a program is to be
started in (!B)(!link [single-mode][Single-mode])(!b) (or in parallel). The
following apply:

sh_wiscr = 100:  (!B)Execute program in parallel(!b)
(!nl)
The new application inherits all standard paths and files from the current
application. An error-code is returned only in case of memory shortage during
the installation; a notification at the termination of the new application
(death-of-child) does not exist (*).

!label Single-mode
sh_wiscr = 101:  (!B)Execute program in single-mode(!b)
(!nl)
This mode corresponds to (!I)sh_wiscr(!i) with the value 1, except that before
the program is called all applica!-tions apart from those with ID 0 and ID 1
(SCRENMGR) are frozen. Those applications will be thawed out again at the
termination of the program, as long as that does not make a new shel_write call
of a single-mode character. (!B)The exact recipe for the single-mode is:(!b)

!begin_itemize !short
!item Ensure that I am application #0 (i.e. ap_id == 0)
!item Set paths and drive for the new program
!item shel_write (TRUE, sh_wisgr, 101, sh_wpcmd, sh_wptail)
!item All important settings to temporary file or shell-buffer
!item appl_exit, v_clsvwk, Pterm0 execute
!end_itemize

One should also note that as of (!nolink [MagiC]) 2, in single-mode the current
paths of the caller are passed to the parent and with that to the new program.
The caller's paths are destroyed subsequently, though this is not critical as the
program will normally follow shel_write with a Pterm call (*).

In (!B)extended mode(!b) one can further specify the launching of programs via
the special bits of the parameter (!I)sh_wdoex.(!i) The low byte stays
untouched here, and for the high byte the following apply:

!begin_table [c|l]
(!I)sh_wdoex(!i) bit !! Meaning
!hline
 8 !! Value of Psetlimit
 9 !! Value of Prenice
10 !! Default directory
11 !! Environment string
12 !! Reserved
13 !! Reserved
14 !! Reserved
15 !! Reserved
!end_table

In this extended mode, the parameter (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) is taken as a pointer to
a set of 32-bit (LONG) values. Each of the above-named bits is assigned a LONG
value which is valid when the corresponding bit is set. The set of 32-bit
values is allocated as follows:

!begin_xlist !short [Elemen]
!item [Element]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [[0!]]
Pointer to the name of the program
!item [[1!]]
Value of Psetlimit (bit 8)
!item [[2!]]
Value of Prenice (bit 9)
!item [[3!]]
Pointer to the default directory; a NULL-pointer in this connection means that
the directory in which the program to be launched lies is selected as the
default directory (bit 10)
!item [[4!]]
Pointer to the environment of the application (bit 11)
!end_xlist

(!B)Note:(!b) The elements [1], [2] and [3] are ignored up to (!nolink [MagiC])
3; element [1] however is supported from MagiC 4 onwards. The default directory
is set much simpler under (!nolink [MagiC]), as the new program inherits all
paths on all drives from the calling program. Geneva can only set bit 8.

(!B)In newer (!nolink [AES]) versions the following additional modes are
available:(!b)

!begin_xlist [sh_wdoe]
!item [sh_wdoex]
Meaning

!label Shutdown mode
!item [4]
(!B)Set Shutdown mode(!b)
(!nl)
This command puts the system into the normal or Shutdown mode, depending on
the parameter (!I)sh_wiscr.(!i) The following apply:

!begin_xlist !short [sh_wisc]
!item [sh_wiscr]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!label Shutdown, Terminate
!item [0]
(!B)Terminate Shutdown sequence(!b)
(!nl)
A started Shutdown can only be terminated by that process that also started
this sequence
!label Shutdown, Partial
!item [1]
(!B)Partial Shutdown(!b)
(!nl)
With the exception of the caller, all applications are checked by the
(!nolink [AES]) on whether they understand the message AP_TERM; if this is
the case, then the (!nolink [AES]) sends the messages (!nolink [AP_TERM]) or
AC_CLOSE to the programs or accessories. The caller receives none of these
messages.
!label Shutdown, Complete
!item [2]
(!B)Complete Shutdown(!b)
(!nl)
With the exception of the caller, all applications and accessories are checked
by the (!nolink [AES]) on whether they understand the message AP_TERM; if this
is the case, then the (!nolink [AES]) sends the messages (!nolink [AP_TERM])
or (!nolink [AC_CLOSE]) to the programs or accessories. Accessories receive
the (!nolink [AP_TERM]) message also after the receipt of the
(!nolink [AC_CLOSE]) message. The caller receives none of these messages.
!end_xlist

In (!nolink [N.AES]) there is an extended call: (!nl)
shel_write(4, shutart, 0, &ignorant, NULL);

(!I)ignorant(!i) is here an integer whose address is passed as the fourth
parameter of the shel_write call. In case of error the return value of the
function shel_write is 0 as before, but in addition, (!I)ignorant(!i) will hold
the apid (application ID) of the application that has not understood
(!nolink [AP_TERM]), or -1 if a Shutdown is already running, or -2 if invalid
parameters were passed.

!label Resolution change
!item [5]
(!B)Resolution change(!b)
(!nl)
The application invites the (!nolink [AES]) to change the resolution. If the
(!nolink [AES]) agrees to the change, it attempts to close down the system
(Shutdown). Any active applications can now either terminate themselves, or tell
the (!nolink [AES]) with an AP_TFAIL message that they are not in a position to
do so. The parameters (!I)sh_wisgr(!i) and (!I)sh_wiscr(!i) are dependent on
one another. The following apply:

!begin_xlist !short [sh_wisc]
!item [sh_wiscr]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [0]
The parameter (!I)sh_wisgr(!i) is the ID of the physical device on which the
'Open workstation' call of the (!nolink [VDI]) is executed. The current physical
device number can be obtained with Getrez + 2 as usual; the following values are
available:
!begin_table [l l l r]
2 !! = !! ST-Low    !!  (320*200)
3 !! = !! ST-Medium !!  (640*200)
4 !! = !! ST-High   !!  (640*400)
6 !! = !! TT-Medium !!  (640*480)
8 !! = !! TT-High   !! (1280*960)
9 !! = !! TT-Low    !!  (320*480)
!end_table
!item [1]
The parameter (!I)sh_wisgr(!i) is the int16_t for the video mode of the Falcon030
!item [>2]
Reserved for future purposes
!end_xlist

In (!nolink [N.AES]) there is an extended call: (!nl)
shel_write(5, vmode, falconflag, &ignorant, NULL); (!nl)
As a resolution change always first starts a complete Shutdown internally, it
could be that here too not all applications understand AP_TERM and so the
resolution change fails prematurely. Similar to the Mode 4 extension
mentioned above, here too the application ID of a non-understander will be held
in (!I)ignorant(!i), or a -1 if a (!nolink [Shutdown]) is running already, or
-2 if a faulty parameter (e.g. an invalid resolution) was passed.

!item [6]
(!B)unknown(!b)

!label Broadcasting of the AES
!label AES Broadcasting
!item [7]
(!B)AES broadcasting(!b)
(!nl)
The application would like to send a message to all other applications present
in the system. Excepted from receipt are only the (!nolink [AES]), the
(!link [screen-manager][The screen-manager]), as well as the sender of the
message itself.

The parameter (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) is a pointer to a 16-byte sized message buffer
that contains the data to be sent.

!label Manipulate AES environment
!label Manipulate environment of the AES
!item [8]
(!B)Manipulation of the (!nolink [AES]) environment(!b)
(!nl)
This command permits the modification of the (!nolink [AES]) environment. The
parameter (!I)sh_wisgr(!i) describes the desired action. The following apply:

!begin_xlist !short [sh_wisg]
!item [sh_wisgr]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [0]
(!B)Get size of environment buffer(!b) This is returned as the function result
!item [1]
(!B)Insertion/Removal of strings(!b) The parameter (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) is a
pointer to the environment string. The syntax for insertion or removal runs:
'NEW=STRING\0' or NEW=\0'.
!item [2]
(!B)Copy contents of the environment buffer(!b) (!nl)
The parameter (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) is a pointer to the receiving buffer, which has
a size of (!I)sh_wiscr(!i) bytes. The function returns the number of bytes that
could not be copied.
!end_xlist

!item [9]
(!B)Show supported messages(!b)
(!nl)
The application tells the (!nolink [AES]), which (new) messages are understood.
This happens via the set bits of the parameter (!I)sh_wisgr.(!i)
!label NM_INHIBIT_HIDE
!begin_xlist !short [Bit 0:]
!item [Bit 0:]
AP_TERM
!item [Bit 1:]
NM_INHIBIT_HIDE (as of (!nolink [XaAES]) 2005-01-16) (!nl)
Prevents the application from being hidden. Useful for some 'desktop' utilities
like Taskbar.
!end_xlist
All other bits (2-15) are not defined at present.

!item [10]
(!B)Send message to the (!nolink [AES])(!b)
(!nl)
The application wants to send a message to the (!nolink [AES]). The parameter
(!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) is a pointer to a 16-byte sized message buffer.

!begin_description
!item [Geneva]
A program can cause a windowed dialog to scroll by sending a WM_ARROWED
message to Geneva. Example:
!begin_verbatim
  int16_t msg[8];

  msg[0] = WM_ARROWED;
  msg[3] = window_handle;
  msg[4] = WA_UPPAGE;
  shel_write( SHW_SENDTOAES, 0, 0, (int8_t *)msg, 0L );
!end_verbatim
!end_description

!label Threads, Creation of
!item [20]
(!B)Create new thread(!b)
(!nl)
With this opcode the application can create a new thread. The following apply:

!begin_xlist !short [Paramete]
!item [Parameter]
Meaning
!item [~]
~
!item [sh_wisgr]
!begin_xlist !short [0 =]
!item [0 =]
Launch program in VT52 window of the application, if one is open
!item [1 =]
Don't open a new window
!item [2 =]
Open a new VT52 window
!end_xlist
!item [sh_wiscr]
0
!item [sh_wpcmd]
Pointer to THREADINFO structure
!item [sh_wptail]
Parameter of type (void *) for the Thread function
!end_xlist

With a successful call the application ID of the new thread will be returned (*).

!label Threads, Ending of
!item [21]
(!B)End thread(!b)
(!nl)
With this opcode a thread can end itself. For this one sets the parameters of
(!I)sh_wisgr(!i), (!I)sh_wiscr(!i) and (!I)sh_wptail(!i) to the values 0 or
NULL; with (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) one can specify an error-code to be returned.

Normally an execution of this function is not necessary, since the thread ends
itself automatically at the end of its procedure (i.e. with the CPU command RTS).
(!B)Important:(!b) If the thread has made a Pexec call, then the running process
must first be terminated with Pterm, before the thread can end itself (*).

!item [22]
(!B)Terminate thread(!b)
(!nl)
With this opcode a thread can also be ended by the main program. For this one
passes in the parameter (!I)sh_wiscr(!i) the application's ID of the thread,
and sets the remaining parame!-ters to the value 0 or NULL.

Normally this function is not necessary, as with the termination of the main
program all associated threads are ended as well. The function was executed
successfully when the value 1 is returned as a result. One should note, however,
that if in the meantime the thread has performed a Pexec, only that program will
be terminated with Pterm (EBREAK); the thread itself is only ended when the
caller has received a THR_EXIT (*).

!label XSHW_RUNANY
!item [224]
(!B)Run an application(!b) (Geneva as of Update 004)
(!nl)
Run an application, letting Geneva determine the type; this is identical to mode
0, except that the XSHD_FLAGS bit of (!I)sw_doex(!i) can also be set (see below)

!label XSHW_RUNAPP
!item [225]
(!B)Run an application(!b) (Geneva as of Update 004)
(!nl)
This is identical to mode 1,
except that the XSHD_FLAGS bit of (!I)sw_doex(!i) can also be set.

!label XSHW_RUNACC
!item [227]
(!B)Run a desk accessory.(!b) (Geneva as of Update 004)
(!nl)
This is identical to mode 3, except that the XSHD_FLAGS bit of
(!I)sw_doex(!i) can also be set.

When XSHD_FLAGS (1<<15) is added to (!I)sw_doex(!i), this means that the last
LONGword of the SHWRCMD passed in the (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) parameter contains the
Geneva program flags to use when executing the application. It is strongly
recommended that a program using XSHD_FLAGS inquire the current flags for the
application and only change the ones it needs to change, rather than making
most of the flags zero or some other random value. See the x_appl_flags section
for an example.

!end_xlist

(!B)Note:(!b) As of MagiC 3, the following specialities are available:

!begin_itemize
!item If a character string is passed in (!I)sh_wptail(!i) that starts with the
 value 255 and is terminated with '\0', the actual length of the command line is
 determined by the (!nolink [AES]) and passed at full length to the DOS. DOS
 constructs from this an ARGV parameter in the environment. If the command line
 is shorter than 127 bytes, it is passed via the basepage and with shel_read, else
 it consists only of the byte with the value 127.

!item If a character string is passed in (!I)sh_wptail(!i) that starts with the
 value 254, then the (!nolink [AES]) expects after this a character string
 'ARGV=something' and a '\0'-separated and with '\0\0'-terminated list of
 parameters. This is passed completely to the DOS, which constructs an ARGV
 parameter from this. If the command line is shorter than 127 bytes, it
 is passed via the basepage and with (!nolink [shel_read]), where the NULLbytes
 are replaced with spaces, else it consists only of the byte with the value 127.
!end_itemize

The presence of the additional features can be inquired with
(!link [appl_getinfo][%apgi_10]) (opcode 10).
               
The shel_write opcodes marked with (*) are at present available only in
(!nolink [MagiC]).

!label shel_write and Single-TOS
(!B)Warning:(!b) If one launches a new (!nolink [AES]) process under Single-
(!nolink [TOS]) with (!nolink [shel_write]), then this will be launched
only after the termination of the running process.

!item [(!nolink [Return]) value:]
An error has arisen only if the value 0 is returned.

                  int8_t *sh_wpcmd, int8_t *sh_wptail );

!item [Beschreibung:]
Die Funktion ermîglicht das Starten eines anderen Programms. Ab AES-Version
4.0 wurde diese Funktion stark erweitert. So lassen sich nun auch Aufgaben
wie ein Herunterfahren des Systems (Shutdown), ein Auflîsungswechsel,
AES-Broadcasting und andere Dinge realisieren.

Der Parameter (!I)sh_wdoex(!i) bestimmt die auszufÅhrende Aktion, die
restlichen Parameter sind im wesentlichen von (!I)sh_wdoex(!i) abhÑngig. Es
gilt:

!begin_xlist !short [sh_wdoe]
!item [(!I)sh_wdoex(!i)]
Bedeutung
!item [~]
~
!item [0]
(!B)Applikation starten(!b)
(!nl)
Der Wert des Parameters (!I)sh_wisgr(!i) (Starten im Grafikmodus, ja oder
nein) wird automatisch vom (!nolink [AES]) gesetzt, indem die File-Extension mit den
Inhalten der AES-Environmentvariablen GEMEXT, TOSEXT und ACCEXT verglichen
wird.
!item [1]
(!B)Applikation im GEM/TOS Modus starten(!b)
(!nl)
Der Parameter (!I)sh_wisgr(!i) legt dabei den Modus fest, in dem das
Programm gestartet werden soll. Es gilt:
!begin_xlist !short [sh_wisgr = 0:]
!item [sh_wisgr = 0:]
als TOS-Programm starten
!item [sh_wisgr = 1:]
als (!nolink [GEM])-Programm starten
!end_xlist
!item [2]
(!B)reserviert(!b)
!item [3]
(!B)Accessorie starten(!b)
(!nl)
Ein Programm soll als Accessorie gestartet werden.
!end_xlist

In den Parametern (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) und (!I)sh_wptail(!i) sind dabei der Name
des zu startenden Programms bzw. ein Zeiger auf die Kommandozeile zu
Åbergeben. Als Default-Verzeichnis wird dabei das Verzeichnis gewÑhlt, in
dem sich das zu startende Programm befindet (Ausnahme: erweiterter Modus mit
gesetztem Bit-10, s.u.).

Die Funktion liefert die (!nolink [AES])-ID des gestarteten Prozesses zurÅck. Ein Wert
von 0 zeigt in diesem Zusammenhang einen Fehler an. öber den Parameter
(!I)sh_wiscr(!i) kann spezifiziert werden, ob (!B)Parameter per ARGV(!b) an
das gestartete Programm Åbergeben werden sollen. Es gilt:

sh_wiscr = 0: ARGV-Verfahren nicht benutzen (!nl)
sh_wiscr = 1: (!nolink [ARGV-Verfahren]) benutzen

!label Paralleles Starten von Programmen
Unter MagiC kann hingegen angegeben werden, ob ein Programm im
(!B)Single-Modus(!b) (oder parallel) gestartet werden soll. Es gilt:

sh_wiscr = 100:  (!B)Programm parallel ausfÅhren(!b)
(!nl)
Die neue Applikation erbt alle Standardpfade und -dateien von der aktuellen
Applikation. Ein Fehlercode wird nur dann zurÅckgeliefert, falls bereits
beim Einrichten ein Speicherplatzmangel aufgetreten ist; eine Benachrichtung
beim Beenden der neuen Applikation (Death-of-Child) existiert nicht (*).

!label Single-Modus
sh_wiscr = 101:  (!B)Programm im Single-Modus ausfÅhren(!b)
(!nl)
Dieser Modus entspricht (!I)sh_wiscr(!i) mit dem Wert 1, mit der Ausnahme,
daû vor Aufruf des Programms alle Applikationen auûer denjenigen mit ID-0
und ID-1 (SCRENMGR) eingefroren werden. Die Programme werden nach Beendigung
des Programms wieder aufgetaut, wenn dieses nicht seinerseits einen neuen
shel_write-Aufruf mit Singlemode Charakter ausgefÅhrt hat. (!B)Das genaue
Kochrezept fÅr den Single-Modus lautet:(!b)

!begin_itemize !short
!item sicherstellen, daû man die Applikation mit ID-0 ist
!item Pfade und Laufwerk fÅr das neue Programm setzen
!item shel_write (TRUE, sh_wisgr, 101, sh_wpcmd, sh_wptail)
!item wichtige Einstellungen in Datei/Shell-Puffer sichern
!item appl_exit, v_clsvwk, Pterm0 ausfÅhren
!end_itemize

Beachtet werden sollte noch, daû ab (!nolink [MagiC]) 2 im Single-Modus die aktuellen
Pfade des Aufrufers an den Parent und damit an das neue Programm Åbergeben
werden. Die Pfade des Aufrufers sind anschlieûend zerstîrt, was aber
unkritisch ist, da dieser auf den shel_write i.a. ein Pterm folgen lÑût (*).

Im (!B)erweiterten Modus(!b), kann Åber spezielle Bits des Parameters
(!I)sh_wdoex(!i) das Starten von Programmen weiter spezifiziert werden. Das
Low-Byte bleibt dabei unangetastet, und fÅr das High-Byte gilt:

!begin_table [c|l]
(!I)sh_wdoex(!i) Bit !! Bedeutung
!hline
 8 !! Wert von Psetlimit
 9 !! Wert von Prenice
10 !! Default-Verzeichnis
11 !! Environment-String
12 !! reserviert
13 !! reserviert
14 !! reserviert
15 !! reserviert
!end_table

In diesem erweiterten Modus wird der Parameter (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) als Zeiger
auf eine Menge von 32bit (Long-)Werten aufgefaût. Jedem der o.g. Bits ist
dabei ein Long-Wert zugewiesen, der gÅltig ist, wenn das entsprechende Bit
gesetzt ist. Die Menge der 32bit Werte ist folgendermaûen belegt:

!begin_xlist !short [Elemen]
!item [Element]

!item [~]

!item [[0!]]
Zeiger auf den Namen des Programms
!item [[1!]]
Wert von Psetlimit (Bit-8)
!item [[2!]]
Wert von Prenice   (Bit-9)
!item [[3!]]
Zeiger auf das Default-Verzeichnis.
(!nl)
Ein Nullzeiger bedeutet in diesem Zusammenhang, daû als Default-Verzeichnis
dasjenige gewÑhlt wird, indem sich das zu startende Programm befindet.
(Bit-10)
!item [[4!]]
Zeiger auf das Environment der Applikation (Bit-11)
!end_xlist

(!B)Hinweis:(!b) Die Elemente [1],[2] und [3] werden bis (!nolink [MagiC]) 3 ignoriert;
Element [1] wird jedoch ab MagiC 4 unterstÅtzt. Das Default-Verzeichnis wird
unter (!nolink [MagiC]) viel einfacher gesetzt, denn das neue Programm erbt alle Pfade
auf allen Laufwerken vom aufrufenden Programm. (!nl)
Bei Geneva wird nur Bit 8 beachtet.

In N.AES gibt es einen erweiterten Aufruf: (!nl)
shel_write(4, shutart, 0, &ignorant, NULL);

(!I)ignorant(!i) ist hierbei ein Integer, dessen Adresse als vierter Parameter des
shel_write-Aufrufs Åbergeben wird. Im Fehlerfall ist der RÅckgabewert der
Funktion shel_write wie bisher 0, zusÑtzlich wird jedoch in (!I)ignorant(!i) die Applikations-ID
(apid) der Applikation hinterlegt, die AP_TERM nicht verstanden hat
bzw. -1, wenn bereits ein Shutdown lÑuft oder -2, wenn ungÅltige Parameter
Åbergeben wurden.

!label Auflîsungswechsel
!item [5]
(!B)Auflîsungswechsel(!b)
(!nl)
Die Applikation fordert das (!nolink [AES]) auf, die Auflîsung zu wechseln. Falls das
(!nolink [AES]) dem Wechsel zustimmt, versucht es, das System herunterzufahren
(Shutdown). Die aktiven Applikationen kînnen sich nun entweder beenden,
oder durch eine AP_TFAIL Nachricht dem AES mitteilen, daû sie hierzu nicht
in der Lage sind. Die Parameter (!I)sh_wisgr(!i) und (!I)sh_wiscr(!i) sind
dabei voneinander abhÑngig. Es gilt:

!end_xlist

In N.AES gibt es einen erweiterten Aufruf: (!nl)
shel_write(5, vmode, falconflag, &ignorant, NULL); (!nl)
Da ein Auflîsungswechsel intern zunÑchst immer einen vollstÑndigen Shutdown
startet, kann es auch hier geschehen, daû nicht alle Anwendungen AP_TERM
verstehen und der Auflîsungswechsel somit frÅhzeitig fehlschlÑgt. Analog zur
obigen Modus-4-Erweiterung wird auch hier die Applikations-ID eines
VerstÑndnislosen in (!I)ignorant(!i) hinterlegt, eine -1, wenn bereits ein (!nolink [Shutdown])
lÑuft oder -2, wenn fehlerhafte Parameter (z.B. unerlaubte Auflîsungen)
Åbergeben wurden.

!label Threads, Beenden von
!item [21]
(!B)Thread beenden(!b)
(!nl)
Mit diesem Opcode kann sich ein Thread selbst beenden. Dazu setzt man die
Parameter (!I)sh_wisgr(!i) (!I)sh_wiscr(!i) und (!I)sh_wptail(!i) auf die
Werte 0 bzw. NULL; Åber (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) kann ein zurÅckzuliefernder
Fehlercode angegeben werden.

Normalerweise ist ein AusfÅhren dieser Funktion nicht notwendig, da sich der
Thread automatisch mit dem Ende seiner Prozedur (d.h. mit dem CPU-Befehl
RTS) selbst beendet. (!B)Wichtig:(!b) Wenn der Thread einen Pexec-Aufruf
durchgefÅhrt hat, so muss zuerst der laufende Prozess per Pterm beendet
werden, bevor sich der Thread beenden kann (*).

!item [22]
(!B)Thread terminieren(!b)
(!nl)
Mit diesem Opcode kann ein Thread auch vom Hauptprogramm beendet werden.
Dazu Åbergibt man im Parameter (!I)sh_wiscr(!i) die Applikations-ID des
Thread, und setzt die Åbrigen Parameter auf den Wert 0 bzw. NULL.

Normalerweise ist diese Funktion nicht notwendig, da mit dem Beenden des
Hauptprogramms automatisch auch alle zugehîrigen Threads beendet werden. Die
Funktion wurde erfolgreich ausgefÅhrt, wenn als Ergebnis der Wert 1
zurÅckgeliefert wird. Zu beachten ist jedoch, daû fÅr den Fall, daû der
Thread inzwischen ein Pexec ausgefÅhrt hat, nur dieses Programm per Pterm
(EBREAK) beendet wird; der Thread selbst ist erst dann beendet, wenn der
Aufrufer ein THR_EXIT empfangen hat (*).

!label XSHW_RUNANY
!item [224]
(!B)Run an application(!b) (Geneva since Update 004)
(!nl)
Run an application, letting Geneva determine the
type. This is identical to mode 0, except that the XSHD_FLAGS bit
of (!I)sw_doex(!i) can also be set (see below).

!label XSHW_RUNAPP
!item [225]
(!B)Run an application(!b) (Geneva since Update 004)

This is identical to mode 1,
except that the XSHD_FLAGS bit of (!I)sw_doex(!i) can also be set.

!label XSHW_RUNACC
!item [227]
(!B)Run a desk accessory.(!b) (Geneva since Update 004)
(!nl)
This is identical to mode 3, except that the XSHD_FLAGS bit of
(!I)sw_doex(!i) can also be set.

When XSHD_FLAGS (1<<15) is added to the (!I)sw_doex(!i), this means that the
last longword of the SHWRCMD passed in the (!I)sh_wpcmd(!i) parameter contains
the Geneva program flags to use when executing the application. (!nl)
It is strongly recommended that a program using XSHD_FLAGS inquire the
current flags for the application and only change the ones it needs to
change, rather than making most of the flags zero or some other random
value. See the x_appl_flags section, below, for an example.

(!B)Hinweis:(!b) Ab MagiC 3 stehen die folgenden Besonderheiten zur
VerfÅgung:

!begin_itemize
!item Wird in (!I)sh_wptail(!i) eine Zeichenkette Åbergeben, die mit dem
      Wert 255 beginnt und mit '\0' abgeschlossen ist, wird die tatsÑchliche
      LÑnge der Kommandozeile vom AES bestimmt und in ganzer LÑnge ans DOS
      weitergereicht. Das DOS konstruiert hieraus einen ARGV-Parameter im
      Environment. Ist die Kommandozeile kÅrzer als 127 Bytes, wird sie Åber
      Basepage und per shel_read Åbergeben, ansonsten besteht sie nur aus
      dem Byte mit dem Wert 127.
!item Wird in (!I)sh_wptail(!i) eine Zeichenkette Åbergeben, die mit dem
      Wert 254 beginnt, erwartet das AES dahinter die Zeichenkette
      "ARGV=irgendwas" und eine durch '\0' getrennte und durch "\0\0"
      abgeschlossene Liste von Parametern. Diese wird vollstÑndig dem DOS
      Åbergeben, das daraus einen ARGV-Parameter konstruiert. Ist die
      Kommandozeile kÅrzer als 127 Bytes, wird sie Åber Basepage und per
      (!nolink [shel_read]) Åbergeben, wobei die Nullbytes durch Leerstellen ersetzt
      werden, ansonsten besteht sie nur aus dem Byte mit dem Wert 127.
!end_itemize

Das Vorhandensein der zusÑtzlichen Features kann per (!link [appl_getinfo][%apgi_10])
