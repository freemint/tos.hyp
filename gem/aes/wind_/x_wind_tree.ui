!end_xlist

This function alters the way in which Geneva draws and processes the
gadgets of a particular window. This allows a program to take control over
how gadgets react to the mouse, and also to add new gadgets.

The gadgets that make up a window are really just another OBJECT tree.
This function allows you to modify it by (optionally) reading the current
tree into a block of your program's memory. Geneva can then be informed
that the modified tree (or, for that matter, any OBJECT tree) should be
used for the window gadgets.

(!B)Note:(!b) This function will only affect windows which have already been created.

If all you need to do in your program is to change the fill patterns or
colors of a gadget, it is better to use wind_set( WF_COLOR ) to accomplish
this task, if possible.

(!B)Mode 0, X_WT_GETCNT (get count & flags)(!b) (!nl)
This mode must be used prior to mode 1. It sets the count element of the
structure pointed to by wtree to contain the number of OBJECTS that make
up the bendow's tree. The tree element is unchanged.
beginning of section
top of page

(!B)Mode 1, X_WT_READ (Read the current tree into the program's
memory)(!b) (!nl)
This mode copies count OBJECTS of the window's current tree into the array
of OBJECTS pointed to by the tree element. The area of memory MUST be
large enough to hold count elements.

Note that any objects in the resulting tree which have the HIDETREE
ob_flag set are inactive, and their sizes and locations may be inaccurate.

If the tree which was being copied was the default OBJECT tree used by
Geneva, then the ob_spec fields of the second (WGMOVE) and seventh
(WGINFO) OBJECTS in the resulting copy will be zero. If this tree is then
set (using mode 2, below), and the X_WTFL_RESIZE bit is on, then the
programmer MUST modify these ob_spec's to point to TEDINFO structures!
Otherwise, Geneva will attempt to set the title and info text in bad
memory locations.
beginning of section
top of page

(!B)Mode 2, X_WT_SET (Set count, flags, and tree address)(!b) (!nl)
This mode changes the attributes. If count is not less than zero, the
window's OBJECT tree and count of objects will be set. The tree element
must point to a static area of memory containing an OBJECT tree. The flags
are always set, regardless of count.

The following bits are defined in the flags element. By default, they are
all set (turned on) for any window that is created. Undefined bits are
reserved for future use and should not be modified.

!begin_itemize
!item Flags bit 0, X_WTFL_RESIZE

         When set, the window's gadgets are automatically resized whenever
         the window's size is changed. If this bit is on, the ordering of
         the OBJECTs which make up the window's tree MUST not change.
         However, more objects can be appended to the end of the tree.
         When this bit is off, Geneva will never change the sizes,
         positions, flags, colors, or text of any object in the tree.

!item Flags bit 1, X_WTFL_CLICKS

         When set, the window responds normally to mouse clicks on the
         gadgets by moving the window, dragging the scroll bars, etc. When
         this bit is off, any mouse clicks (or keyboard equivalents for
         these actions) will be returned as either a WM_ARROWED message to
         indicate which arrow/scroll bar gadget was chosen, or an
         X_WM_SELECTED message for any other gadget. In this case, the
         program is responsible for taking an appropriate action. The Task
         Manager uses this bit in its "Keyboard..." dialog.

!item Flags bit 2, X_WTFL_SLIDERS

         When set, the sliders of a windowed dialog and info bar of a
         window will act normally. When it is off, the sliders for a
         windowed dialog will never change (even if the dialog is moved by
         the application), and clicking on the info left/right arrows will
         do nothing. The Task Manager uses this bit in its "Keyboard..."
         dialog.
