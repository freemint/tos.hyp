A class of windows that will always 'float' ontop of classical windows.
One key feature of windows in any (!nolink [WF_TOPMOST]) state is that they do not
disturb current keyboard focus, and can be used to issue important
messages, status raports, etc., without demanding user interaction.

     !item [0 =] Remove topmost state on the corresponding window.
     !item [1 =] Set topmost state on the corresponding window.
     !item [2 =] Set topmost state and link window visibility to the
            owner's focus. That is, when owner is untopped the
            window disappears, when owner regains focus, the
            window automatically reappears.

Some common characteristics of windows with any (!nolink [WF_TOPMOST]) state set;

!begin_enumerate !compressed
!item Changing the (!nolink [WF_TOPMOST]) state can be done on open windows, but it is 
prefer not if possible.
!item Windows which have TOPMOST state 1 or 2 never get keyboard focus.
!item Windows which have TOPMOST state 1 or 2 never get WM_TOPPED or
   WM_UNTOPPED (!nolink [AES]) messages.
!end_enumerate

State 1: (!nl)
  Setting state 1 will make the corresponding window 'float' ontop of
all other classical windows. State 1 windows will stay ontop until
closed by the user or the application itself.

State 2: (!nl)
  Setting state 1 will make the corresponding window act like windows
with state 1 set, with one important exception; The window is linked to
the window owner's focus status. This means that when the application
that owns the window looses focus, state 2 windows are automatically
made unvisible by the (!nolink [AES]). When the application regains focus, the
window is automatically made visible again. This is done automatically,
and no application handling is necessary.
