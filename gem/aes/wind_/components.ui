!begin_node The components of a window
!label Components of a window

The following illustration shows the window of a (!nolink [GEM]) text editor,
and describes the most important components of this window.

Note that the clickable 'buttons' use characters from the system font,
and may look different if a substitute system font is in use.

When the (!B)Closer(!b) of an application window is clicked on, the window
will close and its contents will be discarded; if it allows user input
(text editors, graphics programs, spreadsheets ...), any changes made
to the contents since the last 'Save' operation are lost. Most well-
behaved applications warn the user with an alert about this and give
a final opportunity to save the changed contents.

When the Closer of a desktop window is clicked on in (!nolink [TOS]), it will
display the next-higher directory level, or, if already showing the
root directory, close the window; some alternative desktops such as
MAGXDESK, Jinnee and Thing offer the option to either behave in the
same way, or can be set for the Closer to shut the window immediately
from any directory level - they use a 'parent' widget at the top of
the window to move to the next-higher level.

The (!B)(!nolink [Title])-bar(!b) shows the full path to the current directory (in a
desktop window) or to the current file (in an application's window).
It may also show other details, such as the current cursor position
etc. (if the window does not have an info-line).

The (!B)Mover(!b) allows the whole window to be moved by clicking and holding
down the left mouse button while dragging the outline of the window
to a new position.

The (!B)Backdrop(!b) button is only present in MagiC and similar system
extensions. If several windows are open, clicking on it places the
window at the bottom of the 'stack', permitting rapid cycling through
the windows.

The (!B)Iconifier(!b) button is only present as of AES Version 4.1 and later
MagiC versions. When clicked on, the window is shrunk to a large icon
at the bottom left of the screen, carrying a suitable identity label.
If several windows are iconified, their icons will be ranged next to
each other. A double-click on the icon will restore the window to its
former position and size.

Clicking on the (!B)Fuller(!b) enlarges the window to fill the screen. A
second click restores the former size.

The (!B)Info-line(!b) provides various items of information about the window's
contents. In applications it is optional and must be provided by the
running program. This also applies to the (!B)menu-line(!b) (may be scrollable
if too long to fit the window) and the (!B)toolbar(!b).

When one of the four (!B)arrows(!b) is clicked on, it scrolls the contents in
the appropriate direction by one line or column if the contents exceed
the current width and/or height of the window. This action repeats if
the mouse button is held down.

The width of the (!B)sliders(!b) indicate what portion of the total contents
is being displayed on the screen in comparison with the shaded area
in the two elevators representing the off-screen portions. Holding
down the left mouse button and dragging the slider allows the window's
contents to be scrolled quickly in the relevant direction.

Clicking in the (!B)elevator(!b) area scrolls the contents by one screen
height or width; this too repeats if the button is held down.

Clicking on the (!B)Sizer(!b) and holding down the left mouse button allows
dragging the window to a new size. During this the outline of the
window appears dotted as an aid to placement. The top left corner
remains in position.
