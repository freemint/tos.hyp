An initialized X_BUF_V2 is one in which all members are 0 except
(!I)buf_len.(!i) This initialized buffer is then passed to appl_init. On
return, if (!I)arch(!i) is 0 then the structure was not filled in by the
(!nolink [AES]); otherwise it was. The (!I)buf_len(!i) field may be reduced if
the (!nolink [AES]) was expecting an earlier version of the structure (i.e.
X_BUF_V1); this should not be a problem because the structures are forward and
backward compatible.
