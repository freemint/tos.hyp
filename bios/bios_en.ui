!label BIOS, The

The (!nolink [BIOS]) ((!B)B(!b)asic(!B)I(!b)nput/(!B)O(!b)utput (!B)S(!b)ystem) functions represent the lowest
level interface between the Atari's operating system and hardware,
and are called via the 680X0 Trap #13. Preferably, these functions
should not be used by application programs, as substantially more
powerful functions on a higher level are available to provide better
alternatives. Altogether the following functions are available:

!begin_xlist [ù Bconstat  ] !short
!item [ù Bconin]
Read a character from a device
!item [ù Bconout]
Send a character to a peripheral unit
!item [ù Bconstat]
Get input status of a peripheral unit
!item [ù Bcostat]
Get status of a standard output device
!item [ù Drvmap]
Get information about attached devices
!item [ù Getbpb]
Get address to the bios parameter block of a unit
!item [ù Getmpb]
Speicherparameterblock ermitteln.
!item [ù Kbshift]
Fetch/set status of the shift keys
!item [ù Mediach]
Ask if the media has been changed
!item [ù Rwabs]
Direct read/write operation on a unit
!item [ù Setexc]
Set an get interrupt vector
!item [ù Tickcal]
Get time difference between two timer calls
!end_xlist

The (!nolink [BIOS]) is reentrant in MagiC. This means that these functions can
be also called up repeatedly from interrupts (as long as the relevant
supervisor stack does not overflow...).


(!B)Note:(!b)

!begin_itemize
!item The <saveptr_area> of the (!nolink [BIOS]) is still present (for reasons
      of compatibility), but it is not used by the system.
!item The stack checks of Turbo C/Pure-C will fail for routines that
     are executed in supervisor-mode (under (!nolink [TOS]) this could happen
     until now only for USERDEF routines in the (!nolink [AES]), that are also
     executed in supervisor-mode).
!end_itemize

If you hook your own routines into the (!nolink [BIOS]), then make sure that you
construct them to be fully reentrant. Make no assumptions about the
contents of the <saveptr_area>!


!label BIOS, Parameter passing in

!label Parameter passing in BIOS
The (!nolink [BIOS]) receives its parameters from the stack; for this the last
argument from the parameter list is stored as the first on the stack.
Function results are returned in the processor register d0. Only
registers d3-d7 and a3-a7 are saved, all others may be altered by
the call.

!begin_node The input/output channels of the BIOS
The following table is a summary of the channels which are known to the
(!nolink [BIOS]). One should note that further channels can be installed
via Bconmap.

!begin_table [c|l|l]
Channel !! Name !! Meaning
!hline
0 !! PRT !! Parallel port
1 !! AUX !! Serial port
2 !! CON !! Console (with (!link [VT-52-sequences][VT-52 terminal]))
3 !! MIDI !! MIDI-port
4 !! IKBD !! Intelligent Keyboard processor
5 !! RAWCON !! Console (without (!nolink [control]) characters)
6 !! ------ !! ST-compatible serial (Modem-1)
7 !! ------ !! SCC Channel-B (Modem-2)
8 !! ------ !! TT-MFP        (Serial-1)
9 !! ------ !! SCC Channel-A (Serial-2)

!end_table


(!B)Note:(!b) Output via Channel-5 (RAWCON) can be (!I)appreciably(!i) faster
than via Channel-2 (CON), as the (!nolink [control]) sequences do not have to be
evaluated. A further advantage arising from this is a greater supply
of characters.

!begin_node Hooking into the reset vector

The recipe for hooking your own routines into the reset-vector runs as
follows:

!begin_itemize
!item Set the system variable resvalid to the value 0x31415926, as
      therwise (!I)resvector(!i) will be completely ignored by the (!nolink [BIOS ignore]).
!item Write the address of your own function in the resvector vector.
!item Jump back from the function via jmp(a6).
!end_itemize

(!B)Important:(!b) A jump back from the (!nolink [installed]) function via rts is
(!I)not(!i) possible, since no stack has been initialised yet at this
time. In practice one could proceed as follows, for instance:

!begin_verbatim
RESMAGIC    equ       $31415926
_resvalid   equ       $426
_resvector  equ       $42a
            .text
install:    move.l    _resvalid,oldvalid
            move.l    #RESMAGIC,resvalid
            move.l    _resvector,oldreset
            move.l    #newreset,_resvector
            rts

            dc.b      "XBRARESV"
oldreset:   dc.l      0

newreset:   move.l    oldreset,_resvector
            move.l    oldvalid,_resvalid
            jmp       (a6)

            .bss
oldvalid:   .ds.l     1
!end_verbatim

(!B)Warning:(!b) So that multiple programs may install themselves, a clean
de-installation must follow the handling of the function.
