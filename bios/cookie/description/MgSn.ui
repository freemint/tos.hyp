(!B)MagiC Mac Sound(!b) driver

Emulation of Falcon's X(!nolink [BIOS]). There is no matrix like the one in the 
Falcon in the MacOS system. Nevertheless it's possible to:
!begin_itemize !compressed
!item  Play samples in 8/16-bit mono and stereo (with/without D2D)
!item  Record 16-bit samples in stereo like the Falcon (with/without D2D)
!item  Select the input source (the current input source when MagiC Mac 
       is started or the number one)
!item  Connect or remove the audio source to the audio output
!item  Set the level output on the two channels
!item  Set the gain input on the two channels
!item  Emulation on the selection of tracks (1 to 4)
!item  FFDI external clock selection compatible
!item  Extended functions added, like the GSXB/MilanBlaster drivers, 
     for example. It's possible to choose the true frequency. Bit 5 
     of the _SND cookie is set. However, 24/32-bit and the mixer are 
     not supported, and only Motorola format is supported.
!item  This driver can run on the Hades! The output is from the YAMAHA 
       chip or the MV16/PSOUND card. In this case audio input functions 
       are removed. The Timer A of the MFP2 is used.
!item  This driver can run on Aranym! The driver uses SDL calls inside 
     Aranym. Recording isn't possible.
