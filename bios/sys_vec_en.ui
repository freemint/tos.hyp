!begin_node The system vectors
!html_name the_system_vectors

As the system variables and vectors represent the lowest level of
the operating system, application programs should access these only
when absolutely necessary. (!B)Explicitly:(!b)

!begin_itemize !compressed
!item Do not alter any system variables that may not be altered.
!item Do not use any system variables if a function of the operating
      system could be called instead (Example: Mfpint).
!end_itemize

The following list contains all system vectors of (!nolink [TOS ignore]):

!begin_xlist [LONG $___]
!item [vector]
Description

!label Vector, SSP-
!label Reset: SSP vector
!item [LONG $000]
(!B)Reset: SSP(!b)
(!nl)
This and the following memory cells contain a mirror image of the first eight
bytes of the ROM. At a reset the value stored here is loaded into the supervisor
stack pointer (though this is not meaningful; the 'real' stack is only
(!nolink [installed]) later by the (!nolink [BIOS]).

!label Vector, PC
!label Reset: PC vector
!item [LONG $004]
(!B)Reset: PC(!b)
(!nl)
At a reset the value found here is loaded into the program counter (PC). So one
finds here the address that is jumped to on a reset.

!label Vector, Bus error
!label Bus Error vector
!item [LONG $008]
(!B)Bus Error vector(!b)
(!nl)
Exception vector 2: Two bomblets
(!nl)
Bus errors arise when one attempts to access regions of memory to which access is
not permitted. In supervisor mode this really can be only nonexistent memory areas.
In user mode this can also happen in attempting to access hardware registers or
regions below $800.

Normally this vector points to the (!nolink [TOS]) routine for the
display of bombs (in this case just two).

!label Vector, Address error
!label Address Error vector
!item [LONG $00c]
(!B)Address Error vector(!b)
(!nl)
Exception vector 3: Three bomblets
(!nl)
The 68000 and 68010 can access odd addresses only byte by byte. This exception
is triggered if one nevertheless attempts a word or longword access (program
counters or stack pointers too may contain no odd addresses).

!label Vector, Illegal instruction
!label Illegal Instruction Error vector
!item [LONG $010]
(!B)Illegal Instruction Error vector(!b)
(!nl)
Exception vector 4: Four bomblets
(!nl)
An attempt was made to perform an illegal instruction. This vector is altered by
many debuggers for using for break-points.

!label Vector, Division by zero
!label Division by Zero Error vector
!item [LONG $014]
(!B)Division by Zero Error vector(!b)
(!nl)
Exception vector 5: No bomblets
(!nl)
Division was by 0 during a DIV command. Normally this vector points to an RTE
instruction; that's why there are no bomblets.

!label Vector, CHK instruction
!label CHK Instruction Exception vector
!item [LONG $018]
(!B)CHK Instruction Exception vector(!b)
(!nl)
Exception vector 6: An exception was created by a CHK instruction.

!label Vector, TRAPV-
!label TRAPV Instruction Exception vector
!item [LONG $01c]
(!B)TRAPV Instruction Exception vector(!b)
(!nl)
Exception vector 7: An exception was created by a TRAPV instruction.

!label Vector, Privilege violation
!label Privilege Violation Exception vector
!item [LONG $020]
(!B)Privilege Violation Exception vector(!b)
(!nl)
Exception vector 8:
(!nl)
An attempt was made to execute an instruction that is permitted only in
supervisor mode. On an Atari TT, the (!nolink [BIOS ignore]) tests whether
the corresponding instruction was a 'move sr,...': unlike on 68000s, this
instruction is permitted only in supervisor mode on the TT. If this is
the case, the (!nolink [BIOS ignore]) will substitute the instruction
'move ccr,...' and attempt to keep the program running.

!label Vector, Trace
!label Trace, Vector for
!item [LONG $024]
(!B)Trace Exception vector(!b)
(!nl)
Exception vector 9: If the trace bit is set in the status register, the address
specified here is jumped to after every instruction.

!label Vector, Line-A
!label Line-A, Vector for
!item [LONG $028]
(!B)Line-A-Vector(!b)
(!nl)
Exception vector 10: An attempt was made to execute an instruction that
contained the value '$A' in the top four bits. At present this vector is
used for the co-called Line-A routines.

!label Vector, Line-F
!label Line-F, Vector for
!item [LONG $02c]
(!B)Line-F Exception vector(!b)
(!nl)
Exception vector 11: An attempt was made to execute an instruction that
contained the value '$F' in the top four bits. It is used up to
(!nolink [TOS]) 1.04 by GEM, and is intended actually for the programmming
of a floating point unit (FPU).
