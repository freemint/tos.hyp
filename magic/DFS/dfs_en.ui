!begin_node MagiC's DFS-concept
!label DFS-concept in MagiC

(!nolink [MagiC]), just as MultiTOS, enables the incorporation of alternative
filesystems (so-called XFSs). Firmly integrated in (!nolink [MagiC]) is only a
single XFS, the DOS_XFS. On top of this XFS sit in turn subdrivers,
the so-called DFS (DOS filesystem), of which two are integrated in
(!nolink [MagiC]), namely the FAT filesystem and the U filesystem (that for
the drive U:).

A DOS filesystem (DFS) is called by DOS_XFS. This includes only the
file functions, while the management of directories is essentially
taken over by the DOS_XFS. Further DFSs can be installed. The effort
for a DFS is (!I)appreciably lower(!i) than for an XFS as many functions are
performed already by the DOS_XFS. The vital prerequisite is a DOS-
conforming directory structure (with 32-bit entries and filenames in
the 8+3 format). This section deals with the items:

d0 !! = !! int mode
a0 !! = !! (!link [DMD][The Drive Medium Descriptor (DMD)]) *d
-> d0 !! = !! long errcode
!end_table

!item [Description:]
The dfs_drv_close function too fulfills two tasks, depending on  (!I)mode(!i):

(!B)1. (!I)mode(!i) == 0:(!b)
(!nl)
The DOS_XFS asks the (!link [DFS][MagiC's DFS-concept]) whether the drive may
be closed. If this is not permitted, then EACCDN must be returned, else
(!nolink [E_OK]) (required e.g. for Dlock). Opened files were already
recognized be the kernel and DOS_XFS, i.e. in that case dfs_drv_close will not
be called at all.

For this reason, generally no altered sector buffers may exist, even those that
are currently being read or written (this is always done via files!). In this
case it suffices, therefore, always to return an (!nolink [E_OK]). Things become
more problematic if one uses a write-back cache. With this it may happen that no
file is open any more, but a buffer still holds data that have to be written back.
The kernel makes a sync call (xfs_sync, which is passed on to dfs_sync) before
the inquiry is made; thus no altered buffers ought to exist any more - if they
do, then for safety's sake the (!link [DFS][MagiC's DFS-concept]) should
return (!nolink [EACCON]).

(!B)2. (!I)mode(!i) == 1:(!b)
(!nl)
The DOS_XFS forces the closing of the drive, the DFS must return E_OK. No
caches may be written back, since the drive is already invalid (after a media
change has been reported already).

With (!nolink [Dlock]), dfs_drv_close is first called in mode 0, then - if no
error has occurred - with mode 1. This strategy will be carried out also even
if at some time a mechanism is built in that monitors the eject button of
interchangeable-media drives or (!nolink [CD])-ROMs, and bars ejection if
necessary.

!item [Parameters:]
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [DMD][The Drive Medium Descriptor (DMD)]) *d
-> d0 !! = !! long errcode
!end_table

!item [Description:]
(!nolink [MagiC]) supports exactly 26 simultaneously active filesystems that
are assigned letters 'A'..'Z'. dfs_drv_open has two tasks:

!begin_enumerate
!item At the first access to a drive (say D:), the kernel creates a DMD (drive
medium descriptor) and 'offers' this to the XFSs. The DOS_XFS offers this again
to all (!link [DFS][MagiC's DFS-concept]) drivers in turn. The entry d_dfs is
still a NULL-pointer, d_drive is initialized (between 0 and 25, corresponding
to 'A'..'Z'). The DFS drivers now attempt to recognize 'their' filesystem on the
drive. If this succeeds, then (!nolink [d_dfs]) and d_root have to be
initialized, in which case the return value is then E_OK. Else EDRIVE is
reported, and the DOS_XFS tries the next DFS.
!item At a repeated access (!nolink [d_dfs]) is already initialized,
      and the DFS has the opportunity to test for a
      medium change. If everything is in order, (!nolink [E_OK])
      has to be returned. Else the disk medium change
      routine of the kernel has to be called and E_CHNG
      returned. For this one obtains the pointer to the
      medium change routine of the kernel with Dcntl.

dfs_ext_fd is used when a file is to be created but the directory is already
full. It is also used during the creation of a folder (Dcreate).

(!I)fd(!i) is a prototype FD, which is already opened in the exclusive mode.
The file has to be extended and the new space initialized with NULLs.

a1 !! = !! (!link [DIR][The directory entry (DIR)]) *dir
d0 !! = !! int cmd
d1 !! = !! long arg
-> d0 !! = !! long errcode
!end_table

!item [Description:]
dfs_fcreate is used for Fcreate, Dcreate and Dcntl. The DOS_XFS has already
found free space in the directory (!I)dd(!i), and - at first in memory -
created the new directory entry (!I)dir.(!i) Those parts of the
(!link [DIR][The directory entry (DIR)]) not used in every
(!link [DFS][MagiC's DFS-concept]) (the cluster number too) are already
initialized with NULLs. The DFS has the opportunity here still to make
corrections and to initialize the reserved DIR areas according to the
file-type before the DOS_XFS writes the whole entry into the directory.

When the call (!nolink [Dcntl]) or Fsymlink occurs, d0 and a0 contain the
relevant parameters, otherwise d0 == 0. If d0 == SYMLINK_CREATE, a symbolic
link must (or at least can, if possible) be created.

-> d0 !! = !! long errcode
If necessary: !! ~ !! ~
a0 !! = !! LINK *l
!end_table

!item [Description:]
dfs_fxattr is required for Fxattr. The DOS_XFS has already entered all the
information, which is identical for all (!link [DFS][MagiC's DFS-concept])s,
into the (!nolink [XATTR]). xattr_blksize as well as xattr_nblocks both still
have to be initialized by the DFS, xattr_size can be adapted for special files,
say. xattr_index has been initialized by the DOS_XFS, with dir_stcl converted
to the Motorola format. In many cases it will be necessary to perform a
correction here, and to pass a pointer to a driver or a (!nolink [global])
data structure, for instance.

With mode d0 == 0 (i.e. follow symbolic links) the DFS must react appropriately
and in the case of a link it has to return in d0 ELINK and in a0 the link. If
(!I)dir(!i) == NULL, then the DOS_XFS has not located a directory entry but an
(!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) (e.g. the root, or an open file).

!item [Description:]
The DOS_XFS has already accessed the file. The (!link [DFS][MagiC's DFS-concept])
only needs to initialize the reserved entries dta_usr1 and dta_usr2 for the next
Fsnext, so that this position can be found again.

File descriptors (FDs) cannot be used in dta_usrm as releasing them during a
'garbage collection' cannot be avoided. Simply blocking the FDs is not possible
either as one cannot predict the end of the Fsfirst/(!nolink [Fsnext]) operation.
An already failed search can be marked by deleting dta_sname, for instance.

(!I)pos(!i) already points to the next entry, i.e. 32 bytes after (!I)dir.(!i) For
symbolic links the (!link [DFS][MagiC's DFS-concept]) has to react appropriately,
pass ELINK in d0 and in a0 a pointer to the link. A link starts with a WORD
(16-bit) for the length of the path, followed by the path itself.

(!B)Warning:(!b) The length must (!B)include(!b) the terminating NULL-byte and also
be even. The link must lie at an even memory address.

The buffer for the link may be static or volatile as the kernel immediately copies
the data elsewhere, with no possibility of a context change happening
inbetween.

'.' and '..' for (!nolink [Dcreate])). In the case of Fxattr the statements of
the (!link [DFS][MagiC's DFS-concept]) can be overwritten with other data.

first opening of a file (after dfs_dir2FD) as well as on duplication of a file
descriptor (say if several programs access a file or a directory simultaneously).
The compatibility of the open-modes (perhaps a shared read) is guaranteed by the
kernel. The device driver can, for instance, modify the open-mode in such a way
that the (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) is always opened as 'exclusive',
or arrange with the bit OM_NOCHECK that it wants to oversee the open-mode itself.
If ddev_open for the prototype FD is called, then fd->fd_multi1 == fd.

If ddev_open returns an error-code, then the FD is simply released again by the
DOS-XFS.

!begin_node ddev_close

The file is closed. The handling of (!B)fd_refcnt(!b) is taken over by the
DOS_XFS. The MX_DDEV driver here only needs to write back any buffers
that may exist.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) *file,
-> d0 !! = !! long errcode
!end_table
!end_node


!begin_node ddev_read

See dev_read.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) *file
d0 !! = !! long count
a1 !! = !! char *buffer
-> d0 !! = !! long amount
!end_table
!end_node



!begin_node ddev_write

See dev_write. The MX_DDEV does not have to bother with the updating
of the directory or the date of last access.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) *file
d0 !! = !! long count
a1 !! = !! char *buffer
-> d0 !! = !! long amount
!end_table
!end_node



!begin_node ddev_stat

See dev_stat.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) *file
a1 !! = !! MAGX_UNSEL *unselect oder NULL
d0 !! = !! int rwflag
d1 !! = !! long apcode
-> d0 !! = !! long status
!end_table
!end_node



!begin_node ddev_seek

See dev_seek.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) *file
d0 !! = !! long where
d1 !! = !! int mode
-> d0 !! = !! long position
!end_table
!end_node



!begin_node ddev_datime

See dev_datime. The MX_DDEV can simply insert a NULL-pointer here,
then the DOS_XFS performs the standard procedure. The DOS_XFS converts
Fcntl(FUTIME, ...) to Fdatime.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) *file
a1 !! = !! int d[2]
d0 !! = !! int setflag
-> d0 !! = !! long errcode
!end_table
!end_node



!begin_node ddev_ioctl

See dev_ioctl. There should be support for the functions FTRUNCATE,
FIONREAD and FIONWRITE at least. DOS_XFS converts Fcntl(FUTIME, ...)
to Fdatime and with that to ddev_datime, i.e. FUTIME does (!I)not(!i) have
to be supported directly by ddev_ioctl.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! FD *file
d0 !! = !! int cmd
a1 !! = !! void *buf
-> d0 !! = !! long errcode
!end_table
!end_node



!begin_node ddev_delete

This function is called only by the U_DFS, i.e. the integrated
(!link [DFS][MagiC's DFS-concept])
file system for drive U:. So if one installs one's own device driver,
this is the time to release its memory and so retire from the system.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) *directory
a1 !! = !! DIR *dir
-> d0 !! = !! long errcode
!end_table
!end_node



!begin_node ddev_getc

See dev_getc. The MX_DDEV can simply insert a NULL-pointer here, then
the DOS_XFS performs the standard procedure, i.e. calls ddev_read.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) *file
d0 !! = !! int mode
-> d0 !! = !! unsigned long c
!end_table
!end_node



!begin_node ddev_getline

See dev_getline. The MX_DDEV can simply insert a NULL-pointer here,
then the DOS_XFS performs the standard procedure, i.e. calls ddev_read.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) *file
a1 !! = !! char *buf
d1 !! = !! long size
d0 !! = !! int mode
-> d0 !! = !! long amount
!end_table
!end_node



!begin_node ddev_putc

See dev_putc. The MX_DDEV can simply insert a NULL-pointer here, then
the DOS_XFS performs the standard procedure, i.e. calls ddev_write.

(!B)Parameters:(!b)
!begin_table [r l l]
a0 !! = !! (!link [FD][The File Descriptor (FD)]) *file
d0 !! = !! int mode
d1 !! = !! long value
-> d0 !! = !! unsigned long count
!end_table
!end_node
!end_node



!begin_node The Disk Transfer Area (DTA) for DFSs

The DTA is used by the old DOS functions (!nolink [Fsfirst]) and Fsnext, whose
clumsy conception by the MSDOS originators still weighs down the
system like a curse. The partitioning into res1/res2 has historical
reasons, to make the structure at least in DOS_XFS as compatible as
possible to old (!nolink [TOS])s. For the DOS_XFS and with that for all DFSs
the structure looks as follows:

!begin_verbatim
dta_sname:  DS.B    12       /* 0x00: Search name (from Fsfirst)   */
dta_usr1 :  DS.L     1       /* 0x0c: For free user assignment     */
dta_usr2 :  DS.L     1       /* 0x10: For free user assignment     */
dta_drive:  DS.B     1       /* 0x14: Logical drive (0..25)        */
dta_attr :  DS.B     1       /* 0x15: Found attribute              */
dta_time :  DS.W     1       /* 0x16: Found time                   */
dta_date :  DS.W     1       /* 0x18: Found date                   */
dta_len  :  DS.L     1       /* 0x1a: Found length                 */
dta_name :  DS.B    14       /* 0x1e: Found filename               */
!end_verbatim

(!B)Note:(!b) Here there are two LONGwords for free assignment by the user.
(!I)dta_sname(!i) contains the search name already in the current format.
In (!I)dta_usr1(!i) and (!I)dta_usr2(!i) one must enter the current position of the
search, so that a following Fsnext continues the search at the correct
position.

!begin_node Installation of a DFS

A (!link [DFS][MagiC's DFS-concept]) is simply a program that installs the driver and then terminates
itself as resident. The installation takes place with: (!nl)
dosfunctions = (!B)Dcntl(DFS_INSTDFS, "U:\\", &myxfs)(!b); (!nl)
the path "U:\\" is important, because the (!nolink [Dcntl]) call is performed not
by the (!nolink [MagiC]) kernel, but by the DOS-XFS. The return value will be a
pointer to important (!link [XFS][MagiC's XFS-concept]) functions, or an error-code.

The DOS_XFS functions can also be inquired for independent of the
installation of a DFS by using: (!nl)
dosfunctions = (!B)Dcntl(DFS_GETINFO, "U:\\", NULL)(!b); (!nl)
with kernel = (!B)Dcntl (KER_GETINFO, NULL, NULL)(!b) one obtains the kernel
functions.

The deinstallation of a DFS is (!I)not(!i) provided for.
