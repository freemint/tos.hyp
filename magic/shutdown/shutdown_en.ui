!begin_node General remarks about shutdown

(!nolink [Shutdown]) is to be understood as a mechanism that allows the system
to be run down in a controlled manner. In a multitasking environment
it is actually no longer permissible to simply switch off the computer
after use; a reset with the reset button should be taboo as well.
Rather one must ensure that all programs have been terminated properly
and all files closed correctly before the current to the computer is
turned off. If this is ignored, then data losses may well result.

For this reason UNIX systems or the Apple Macintosh, for instance,
have a (!nolink [Shutdown]) mechanism; such a one was also introduced by Atari in
MultiTOS and is also available in MagiC (as of Version 3.0).

(!nolink [Shutdown]) is activated normally via the menu entry 'File/(!nolink [Shutdown])' on
the desktop, with the key combination [[Control]-[Alternate]-[Delete],
or by a resolution change. During the (!nolink [Shutdown]), no programs can be
launched.

!begin_node Shutdown in MultiTOS

Under MultiTOS, programs must do the following to support the (!nolink [Shutdown])
mechanism:

!begin_itemize
!item Call shel_write (with (!I)sh_wdoex(!i)= 9), to inform the (!nolink [AES])
that they understand the AP_TERM message

!item Terminate on receipt of an (!nolink [AP_TERM]) message, or send AP_TFAIL
!end_itemize

(!B)Note:(!b) MultiTOS sends the (!nolink [AP_TERM]) message here only to those processes
that explicitly understand (!nolink [AP_TERM]). As hardly any programs exist at
present that dismiss a corresponding (!nolink [shel_write]), an implementation
such as this in (!nolink [MagiC]) would not give the desired result. Hence a
different procedure was chosen, in which the (!nolink [AP_TERM]) message is sent
to (!I)all(!i) running applications.

!end_node



!begin_node Shutdown in MagiC

Under MagiC the (!nolink [Shutdown]) works a follows: all running programs receive
an AP_TERM message signalling that they should terminate themselves.
If there are still programs in memory after a certain time, then
SHUTDOWN outputs an error-message. In the file SHUTDOWN.INF one can
specify program names (without a suffix such as '.prg' or '.app') that
are uncritical and should not lead to an error-message from (!nolink [SHUTDOWN]).

In addition to this the following points have to be heeded:

!begin_itemize
!item If [Control]-[Alternate]-[Delete] is to be used to terminate the
     system, one must ensure that the screen is not locked, i.e. that
     a program is not currently processing a dialog box or alert on
     the screen, for instance. Furthermore a suitable shell (such as
     MAGXDESK, Thing or Jinnee) must have been loaded, i.e. no program
     may be loaded in '(!link [single-mode][Single-mode])' or in the 'Shell not resident'
     mode (say with [Alternate]-double-click).
!item f the screen is locked, then only the writeback-demon will be
     terminated, i.e. the cache written back. Only after the screen
     is released (i.e. after closing of the dialog or alert box) can
     the (!nolink [Shutdown]) be performed.
!item Should the system have crashed in such a way that no (!nolink [Shutdown]) is
     possible any more, then [Control]-[Alternate]-[Delete] should be
     performed for a second time; a warm start will be carried out
     without programs being terminated
!item If '(!link [single-mode][Single-mode])' is active or the shell is not loaded, then
     again only the writeback-demon will be terminated and the cache
     written back. For a complete (!nolink [Shutdown]) the running program has to
     be terminated so that the shell is active again. The (!nolink [Shutdown])
     then (!I)must(!i) be performed via the 'File/(!nolink [Shutdown])' menu entry.
!end_itemize

(!B)In (!nolink [MagiC]) 4, the (!nolink [Shutdown]) mechanism was revised as follow:(!b) The (!nolink [AES])
now sends a (!nolink [SHUT_COMPLETED]) message with msg[3] = 0 (i.e. '(!nolink [Shutdown])
terminated unsuccessfully') and msg[4] = -1 (invalid ap_id) if there
are still programs running in the system that do not understand
AP_TERM explicitly. With that, a program that only masters the
MultiTOS specification will break off the (!nolink [Shutdown]). SHUTDOWN.PRG, on
the other hand, was adapted to the new specification, and functions as
previously, i.e. gives all programs still running a timeout and then
outputs the names of all reluctant applications.

In addition, the application #0 is no longer passed arbitrary data
in msg[4,5,6,7] on [Control]-[Alternate]-[Delete], but the following
message:

!begin_verbatim
  msg[3]     = -1
  msg[4,6,7] =  0
  msg[5]     = AP_TERM
!end_verbatim

!end_node



!begin_node Shutdown as seen by the application

First one should point out that the (!nolink [Shutdown]) mechanism in MultiTOS
differs from that in (!nolink [MagiC]): Atari's MultiTOS sends an (!nolink [AP_TERM]) message
only to those applications that have explicitly informed the (!nolink [AES])
with (!nolink [shel_write]) (opcode 9) that they understand the (!nolink [AP_TERM]) message;
on the other hand (!nolink [MagiC]) sends the mssage to all active applications.

The (!nolink [Shutdown]) will be seen by the (!nolink [AES]) as successful only when all
programs explicitly understanding AP_TERM have terminated themselves.
If an application should intimate that it cannot terminate itself,
then the (!nolink [Shutdown]) will be broken off. For these reasons, every program
receiving an (!nolink [AP_TERM]) message has principally only two options:

!begin_itemize !short
!item It terminates itself immediately
!item It makes the following call
!begin_verbatim
msg[0] = AP_TFAIL;
msg[1] = err;
shel_write(10, 0, 0, (char *) msg, NULL);
!end_verbatim
     and so informs the (!nolink [AES]) that the process was interrupted with the
     error-code (!I)err.(!i) The application that has caused the (!nolink [Shutdown]) is
     told the ap_id and error-code of the interrupting application.
!end_itemize

If the application reacts differently on the other hand, i.e. ignores
the (!nolink [AP_TERM]) message, then the behaviour of the system depends on
whether it was informed that the (!nolink [AP_TERM]) message is understood.
(!B)In plain language:(!b)

!begin_itemize
!item If the application (!I)explicitly(!i) understands (!nolink [AP_TERM]) then the
     system starts from the assumption that the application cannot
     accept any messages at the time. The (!nolink [Shutdown]) is not interrupted,
     but lasts until the caller (generally the program SHUTDOWN)
     terminates the (!nolink [Shutdown]). (!nolink [SHUTDOWN]) uses a timeout for this of
     3 seconds, i.e. if 3 seconds after the start of the (!nolink [Shutdown])
     programs are still active that understand (!nolink [AP_TERM]), the program
     will break off the (!nolink [Shutdown]) process.
!item If the application does (!I)not(!i) explicitly understand AP_TERM,
     then the system tells the initiator of the (!nolink [Shutdown]) (generally
     SHUTDOWN.PRG) that the (!nolink [Shutdown]) process has been successful.
     Only because the SHUTDOWN.PRG is so indulgent with old programs,
     it tests whether any applications are still active, and outputs
     a message if so. One can specify in the file SHUTDOWN.INF the
     programs that should not lead to an error-message, i.e. that
     need not be terminated.
!end_itemize

(!B)Note:(!b) If the (!nolink [Shutdown]) was started with [Alternate]-[Control]-[Delete],
then at first only the writeback-demon and the application with the
ID 0 receives an (!nolink [AP_TERM]) message; -1 is entered as sender for this.
Application 0 (generally the desktop) then terminates itself and then
starts the (!nolink [Shutdown]) program.

!begin_node Shutdown as seen by the initiator

(!nolink [Shutdown]) and resolution change are taken on in (!nolink [MagiC]) by the program
SHUTDOWN, which is called with the following parameters:

(!nolink [SHUTDOWN]).PRG dev txt

For this (!I)dev(!i) = -1 if a (!nolink [Shutdown]) (!I)without(!i) a resolution change is
to be performed, else = the device number of the (!nolink [VDI]) screen driver.
(!I)txt(!i) is the text height for the (!nolink [AES]); generally this should be 0.

A (!nolink [Shutdown]) is started with ret = shel_write(4, TRUE, 0, NULL, NULL).
Here a return value of 0 signals that a (!nolink [Shutdown]) is not possible,
because a (!nolink [Shutdown]) is already running, for instance. A resolution
change is performed with ret = shel_write(5, dev, 0, NULL, NULL);
here (!I)dev(!i) is the (!nolink [VDI]) device driver. Alternatively, one can specify a
Falcon resolution mode in (!I)xdv(!i) with (!nolink [shel_write])(5, xdv, 1, NULL, NULL).

These calls are all MultiTOS-conform. In addition, as of MagiC 3 the
following call exists: ret = (!nolink [shel_write])(5, dev, 100+txt, NULL, NULL).
With this one can set the text height for the (!nolink [AES]). One cannot pass a
Falcon resolution with this mode, so (!I)dev(!i) is the device number of the
(!nolink [VDI]) screen driver.

The device number depends on the system in use and the (!nolink [VDI]). With a
'naked' ST or TT030 (without graphics card) the following allocations
apply:

!begin_table [l l l]
1 !! Default resolution !! ~
2 !! ST-Low            !! (320*200*16)
3 !! ST-Medium         !! (640*200*4)
4 !! ST-High           !! (640*400*2)
6 !! TT-Medium         !! (640*480*16)
8 !! TT-High           !! (1280*960*2)
9 !! TT-Low            !! (320*480*256)
!end_table

When using a graphics card, or on a Macintosh, the device numbers are
found as usual in the ASSIGN.SYS file in the root directory of the
boot drive.

After a successful (!nolink [shel_write]) call the system will be in the (!nolink [Shutdown])
mode and no more programs can be launched. On successful completion
of the (!nolink [Shutdown]) or a resolution change the initiator receives the
following message:

!begin_xlist !short [msg+0+ =]
!item [msg[0!] =]
SHUT_COMPLETED
!item [msg[3!] =]
1 - (!nolink [Shutdown]) successful
!end_xlist

or with a resolution change:

!begin_xlist !short [msg+0+ =]
!item [msg[0!] =]
RESCH_COMPLETED
!item [msg[3!] =]
1 - (!nolink [Resolution change]) successful
!end_xlist

Successful as far as the system is concerned means that all progams
that understand AP_TERM have terminated themselves. If the (!nolink [Shutdown])
should be broken off nevertheless, then this can be done by using
ret = shel_write(4, FALSE, 0, NULL, NULL). Otherwises a resolution
change will be performed irrevocably when the initiator has terminated
itself. On the other hand the (!nolink [Shutdown]) will be broken off when the
initiator terminates.

If a program has refused a (!nolink [Shutdown]) with AP_TFAIL, then the initiator
receives the following message:

!begin_xlist !short [msg+0+ =]
!item [msg[0!] =]
(!nolink [SHUT_COMPLETED])
!item [msg[3!] =]
0 - Break off (!nolink [Shutdown])
!item [msg[4!] =]
ap_id of the application that has refused
!item [msg[5!] =]
Error-code of this application
!end_xlist

bzw. beim (!nolink [Aufl”sungswechsel])

!begin_xlist !short [msg+0+ =]
!item [msg[0!] =]
(!nolink [RESCH_COMPLETED])
!item [msg[3!] =]
0 - (!nolink [Resolution change]) broken off
!item [msg[4!] =]
ap_id of the application that has refused
!item [msg[5!] =]
Error-code of this application
!end_xlist

In this case the system has already terminated the (!nolink [Shutdown]) or
resolution change, i.e. the initiator cannot do anything any more.

(!B)Note:(!b) Because it is possible that the (!nolink [Shutdown]) process is never
reported by the system as complete or broken off (the @{"RESCH_COMPLETED" ignore}
or (!nolink [SHUT_COMPLETED]) message is never sent), the initiator should forsee
a timeout while waiting for the message. In that case the (!nolink [Shutdown])
must be broken off explicitly. With appl_search the initiator can
test whether there are still programs active that do not understand
(!nolink [AP_TERM]) explicitly.
