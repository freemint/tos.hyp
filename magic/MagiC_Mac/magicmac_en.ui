!begin_node General remarks about MagiC Mac

The core of the 'emulation' of the Atari environment on the Macintosh
lies in the reprogramming of the PMMU. Both Atari as well as Macintosh
programs assume that they will find certain variables (the so-called
(!link [system variables][The system variables])) in the lowest 2 kB of the address space. However,
when an Atari program is running it expects other values there than,
say, the Mac operating system. The so-called kernel of (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac makes
sure that - depending on whether a Mac or an Atari routine is running
at the time - suitable system variables are present in that lower
address space. This is done with appropriate programming of the PMMU,
a coprocessor for memory management.

(!B)So there are two MMU modes:(!b) The Mac- and the Atari-mode. By means of
two routines one can switch back and forth between them. Starting
from taking the Mac-mode as the normal mode, the following changes
occur when switching to the Atari-mode:

!begin_itemize
!item A memory block that was allocated somewhere on the Macintosh heap
     is inserted from address $0 into the Atari address space. This
     block is between 4 and 32 kB long and is guaranteed to hold only
     the exception vector table and the documented
     (!link [system variables][The system variables]).
!item Address space from $00FF8000 to $00FFFFFF (and correspondingly
     $FFFF8000 to $FFFFFFFF) is blanked out. On the Atari this is
     the I/O address space, which is not normally available on the
     Macintosh (which at most has RAM there).

     So that programs do not erroneously address this space as RAM,
     if the Macintosh has some there, this blanking out leads to a
     bus error at each access. It is however possible that special
     Atari-compatible hardware has been installed in the Macintosh,
     whereupon this hardware then blends in this address space at the
     relevant positions. (!B)This means:(!b) A program that recognizes that
     it is running under (!nolink [MagiC]) on the Mac should (!I)not(!i) automatically
     assume that no Atari hardware is present in the I/O area, but
     should continue to check with a test access (by diversion of the
     bus error vector) whether access to the module is possible.
!item RAM that belongs neither to the TPA of (!nolink [MagiC]), nor to the (!nolink [MagiC])
     OS or the kernel data and routines is not present in the Atari
     address space, i.e. accesses outside the area specially reserved
     for Atari programs lead to a bus error. This protects other
     Macintosh applications better from faulty Atari programs. This
     protection however works (!I)only(!i) with 68k machines, (!I)not(!i) with
     PowerPCs!

!begin_node MagiC Mac and Power-Macs

(!nolink [MagiC]) Mac naturally also runs on the new PCI machines from Apple
(Power Macintosh 7600, 8200, 8500 and 9500). (!B)When using this hardware
the following points should be borne in mind:(!b)

!begin_itemize
!item  The address areas not used by (!nolink [MagiC]), but present in the Mac
     address space, can (!I)not(!i) be blanked out and so also (!I)not(!i) protected
     from access. This means that accesses outside the TPA and the
     program and heap area of (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac will (!I)not(!i) have bus errors
     reported, as is the case with 68k computers.
!item  With the PowerMac models since mid-1995 the upper address area
     is used for PCI cards and/or ROM. So on accessing the Atari I/O
     area in $FFFF8000 - $FFFFFFFF one gets (!I)no(!i) bus errors but only
     (!B)undefined data(!b). Unfortunately this cannot be changed. It is
     recommended therefore that programs access the I/O area only in
     the range $00FF8000 - $00FFFFFF, to either check for the presence
     of component modules (by making an access to them and checking
     whether this leads to a bus error), or work with the hardware
     extension (!I)McSTout(!i) in case it is also made available for the
     PCI-Macs. Programs can recognize these circumstances by the state
     of bit 5 in (!link [Cookie.flags1][%mmcookie_flgs1]).

!begin_node Cookies under MagiC Mac

(!nolink [MagiC]) Mac naturally also supports the cookie jar, and creates the
following cookies:

!begin_xlist !short [Cookie]
!item [Cookie]
Meaning in (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac
!item [~]
~
!item [(!link [_CPU][Cookie, _CPU])]
Contains the value 20, 30 or 40. On 68000 machines MM does not run; on PowerPC
machines a 68020 will be indicated
!item [(!link [_FDC][Cookie, _FDC])]
$014D6163 - The last 3 bytes result in the text 'Mac'
!item [(!link [_FPU][Cookie, _FPU])]
The usual values; with a 68040 there will only be an 8 here if the associated
FPU software is installed as well
!item [(!link [_MCH][Cookie, _MCH])]
No Atari-compatible hardware present (-1)
!item [(!link [_SND][Cookie, _SND])]
0
!item [(!link [_VDO][Cookie, _VDO])]
No Atari-compatible video hardware present (-1)
!item [(!link [MagX][Cookie, MagX])]
Same as in MagiC
!item [(!link [MgMc][Cookie, MgMc])]
Points to a (!link [MgMcCookie][The MagiC Mac cookie]) structure
!item [(!link [MNAM][Cookie, MNAM])]
Pointer to NULL-terminated string with the name of the computer; this only
serves as information for the user
!item [(!link [PMMU][Cookie, PMMU])]
NULL; shows that the MMU is engaged and may not be used by other programs
!end_xlist

!end_node



!begin_node Filesystems under MagiC Mac

(!nolink [MagiC]) Mac, just like (!nolink [MagiC]), permits the incorporation of alternative
filesystems. At present the following systems are supported:

!begin_itemize
!item (!B)FAT filesystems according to (!nolink [TOS]) conventions:(!b) This allows floppy
     disks as well as hard disks in the usual Atari format to be
     accessed with all (!nolink [TOS]) functions ((!nolink [GEMDOS]), but also e.g. @{"Rwabs" ignore}).
!item (!B)Mac filesystems:(!b) As these do not have a FAT, access to these
     drives is only possible via (!nolink [GEMDOS]), but not via (!nolink [BIOS]).
!end_itemize

(!B)The Mac filesystem under (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac:(!b)

As the (!nolink [GEMDOS]) functions are mapped directly to the Mac filesystem
functions for the most part, all file formats usable under MacOS can
be used under (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac as well, i.e. once one can 'mount' a drive on
the Mac, it is (or its folder contents are) also installable under MM.
Thanks to this one can also use (!nolink [CD]])-ROMs or network drives without any
further drivers in (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac as a rule. (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac also allows the Mac-
typical ejection of a floppy disk, for instance.

!end_node



!begin_node Restrictions of MagiC Mac

(!nolink [MagiC]) Mac does (!I)not(!i) implement all functions that (!nolink [MagiC]) offers for
Ataris. (!nolink [AES, VDI and GEMDOS]) are implemented completely, but there are
restrictions with (!nolink [BIOS]) and (!nolink [BIOS]). However it is possible to restore
some of the functionalities with add-ons such as (!I)McSTout(!i) or a sound
driver.

!begin_itemize
Unimplemented or ignored functions with (!nolink [BIOS]):
(!nl)
      (!nolink [Initmouse]), (!nolink [Mfpint]), (!nolink [Ikbdws]), (!nolink [Jdisint]),
      (!nolink [Jenabint]), (!nolink [Giaccess]), (!nolink [Offgibit]),
      (!nolink [Ongibit]), (!nolink [Xbtimer]), (!nolink [Dosound]).
!end_itemize

(!B)Additionally there are restrictions with some functions, mainly in
connection with the filesystem and the devices:(!b)

!begin_itemize
!item The MIDI workstation is not usable at present unless the hardware
     extension (!I)McSTout(!i) with MIDI option is installed. It may also be
     that MIDI will be realized in the future via one of the serial
     ports of the Mac, so all that one can say is: Whether MIDI can be
     used must be established by the user - a program cannot recognize
     that by itself in practice. The same applies for (!nolink [Midiws]).
!item The IKBD workstation is not present
!item If (!nolink [Getbpb]) returns 0 it may be that a Mac-formatted floppy disk
     is in the drive, which (!I)nevertheless(!i) can be accessed with the
     file functions via drive A:
!item If a Mac-formatted disk is in the floppy drive, then (!nolink [Rwabs]) will
     return an error ('Drive not ready'); the files on the disk can,
     if necessary, be accessed (!I)nevertheless(!i) with the (!nolink [GEMDOS]) file
     functions
!item (!nolink [Drvmap]) also returns set bits for the drives that are Mac-
     formatted and so are only addressable via (!nolink [GEMDOS]) and not with
     Rwabs
!item (!nolink [Getrez]) always returns 2 (ST-High), so is unusable
!item (!nolink [Setscreen]) can only alter the physical address if the user has
     launched (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac in ST-resolution emulation mode (e.g. ST-High).
     To recognize whether this is the case one should first attempt
     to alter the address with (!nolink [Setscreen]) and then check with
     (!nolink [Physbase]) whether the address let itself be altered.
!item (!nolink [Floprd]), (!nolink [Flopwr]), snd (!nolink [Flopver]) do not work if Mac-formatted disks
     are inserted (implemented only as of MM 1.2.2). The bad sector
     list of (!nolink [Flopver]) reports in case of error all sectors of the
     track as defective, as the exact track can not be ascertained.
!item Flopfmt can format floppy disks as of MM 1.2.2, but only with
     80 tracks, 2 sides and depending on the inserted disk, 9 or 18
     sectors per track. With the (!link [MgMc cookie][Cookie, MgMc]) one can check what kind
     of disk (DD or HD) is in the drive. (!B)Don't be surprised:(!b) The Mac
     only offers a function to format (!I)all tracks at once.(!i) Hence this
     is solved with MM in such a way that a (!nolink [Flopfmt]) call for track 0
     (or 79, depending on where one starts) will format the whole disk
     and a (!nolink [Flopfmt]) call for the remaining tracks will do nothing, so
     that the function returns immediately with an error-code 0. In
     the case of a formatting problem, an error is reported for all
     tracks. As a result the disk to be formatted must be completely
     in order.
!item Rsconf: The MPF-specific parameters are ignored
!item Puntaes knows several modes, (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac is terminated if
   necessary

!begin_node Exceptions under MagiC Mac

As on a real Atari, an Atari program running under (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac can use
the exception vectors, namely divert them. Actually the program may
use only the exception vectors between $0 and $400 for this, not those
to which the VBR points (because that points elsewhere!). Those who
do not adhere to this may run into difficulties with later versions
of (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac. Programs that use the (!link [PMMU][Cookie, PMMU]), e.g. (!I)OUTSIDE(!i) can (!I)not(!i) run
under (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac.

(!B)The following Atari interrupts are simulated by the kernel at
present:(!b)

!begin_itemize
!item $070: Autovector interupt Level 4 (VBL)
!item $114: MFP interrupt 5 (200 Hz system timer)
!item $118: MFP interrupt 6 (IKBD). Actually only the event of key presses and
     mouse movements is simulated here, i.e. the interrupt handler obtains the
     specific type of the event in some other way than on the Atari.
!end_itemize

Due to the Mac hardware, however, the interrupts may appear with
(!I)different priorities(!i); consequently the interrupt mask of the SR has
other values to that on an Atari in some circumstances. The vector at
$400 (etv_timer) will also be jumped to by the (!nolink [MagiC]) OS, of course,
as a subroutine of the interrupt handler for MFP interrupt 5, in just
the same way as on an original Atari.

Likewise a program that would like to experience mouse or keyboard
events can use the (!nolink [BIOS]) function Kbdvbase to hook itself into the
event vectors in exactly the same way as on the Atari.

(!B)Another important note about interrupts:(!b) So that the keyboard, mouse
and timer work properly on a Mac, the interrupt mask (in CPU register
SR) must always be zero. On an Atari, on the other hand, it normally
stands at three. Programs containing code such as MOVE #$2300,SR for
instance, would put a Macintosh into a (!I)sleep state(!i), which only a
reset can remedy. Those who want to alter the interrupt mask only
occasionally should do it this way (works equally well on an Atari
and Mac):

!begin_verbatim
  MOVE SR,-(a7)    ; Store old SR
  ORI  #$0700,SR   ; Block all interrupts for a critical access
  ...
  MOVE (a7)+,SR    ; At end, restore old SR
!end_verbatim

Those who definitely want to return the computer to its basic state
should (!I)not(!i) use MOVE #$2300,SR but better MOVE #$2000,SR. On the Atari
the SR will then be increased to $2300 just before the HBL interrupt
routine. In this way the same code achieves te same result on both
machines.

If interrupt or other asynchronous routines are installed by means of
MacOS functions and then these functions are to switch from the Mac-
mode to the Atari-mode, then several things need to be heeded, which
are described in greater detail below:

!begin_itemize
!item Setting of a semaphore (see intrLock/intrUnlock)
!item Query whether an Atari-mode switch is even possible at the time
     (see atariModePossible)
!item  Deinstallation of the routine at the termination of (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac
     (see macAppSwitch)
!item Before switching into the Atari-mode one must ensure that the
     stack pointer (SP) lies within the Atari address space, since
     otherwise a double bus error arises and the CPU will come to a
     standstill

     (!B)Note:(!b) First: It may be that the call of the routine by the MacOS
     occurs at a time when another Mac application is running, in
     which case the current stack is (!I)not(!i) that of (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac.
     Second: With the 68k machines, in Atari-mode only the address
     space of the 2 TPAs, the lowest 32 kB, if necessary the I/O area
     as well as the area of the (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac application is visible; other
     memory of MacOS and other Mac applications is blanked out, and
     only bus errors will arise if access is attempted. (!B)To sum up:(!b)
     To make sure that the SP lies in the Atari address space when
     switching into the Atari MMU mode, one must previously reserve
     a stack area for this and then use that. To ensure that the stack
     is large enough (1-2 kB are (!I)clearly not enough!(!i)) one should
     heed the cookie value minStackSize!
!item Always switch to supervisor-mode before 'modeAtari' is called
     (else it won't run under virtual memory). The following code is
     suggested for this:
!begin_verbatim
             clr     d0
             move    sr,d0
             btst    #13,d0
             bne     ok1
             moveq   #8,d0        ;   Enter supervisor-mode
             dc.w    $A08D        ;   _DebugUtil
       ok1:
             move    d0,-(a7)     ;   Save the old mode

             ; Here now modeAtari ... Call modeMac etc.

             move.w  (a7)+,sr     ;   Restore old mode
!end_verbatim
!item Mac subroutines may only alter the registers d0-d2/a0/a1 as a
     rule, though not (as often usual on the Atari), a2!

!end_node



!begin_node Clean programming

Even if the specific implementation of (!link [MagiC Mac][MagiC Mac specifics]) is not of interest
to every Atari programmer, there are some basic rules that one should
adhere to on the Atari level to be as certain as possible that the
programs can run also under (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac. Here the following points
can be mentioned, amongst others:

!label Code, self-modifying
!label Self-modifying code
!label CPU cache purging
!label Cache purging, CPU
!label Purging of the CPU cache
!label MC680x0 cache purging

!begin_itemize
!item (!B)Self-modifying code(!b)
(!nl)
     When code (also applies for XBRA vectors) is altered, it is
     imperative that the CPU cache is purged. Although by testing
     one can ascertain whether this is not necessary on a 68020 with
     its small cache, one can never be certain: On the Mac there is a
     68k emulator for the PowerPC machines that simulates a 68020,
     which, first, has a larger cache than a real 68020 (inclusive of
     a data cache which is otherwise present only with the 68030),
     and second also compiles the code into PowerPC code.

     If the code of an Atari program is then changed, the emulator can
     only recognize this is a command for cache purging is executed.
     Equally, a cache purge is necessay as a rule with the 68040/60
     CPUs! Here is the code with which the whole cache is purged in
     such cases:

!begin_xlist !short [Prozessor]
!item [Processor]
Code
!item [~]
~
!item [68020/30]
!begin_verbatim
      MOVE  CACR,D
      ORI.W #$0808,D0
      MOVE  D0,CACR
!end_verbatim
(!U)or also like this:(!u)
!begin_verbatim
      DC.W  $4E7A,$0002,$0040,$0808,$4E7B,$0002
!end_verbatim
!item [68040/60]
!begin_verbatim
      NOP
      CPUSHA DC/IC
!end_verbatim
(!U)or:(!u)
!begin_verbatim
      DC.W   $4E71,$F4F8
!end_verbatim
!end_xlist

     The processor type should be obtained for this by inspection of
     the (!link [_CPU][Cookie, _CPU]) cookie.
!item (!B)Blocking interrupts(!b)
(!nl)
     If the interrupts have to be bloked for a short time, then (!I)never(!i)
     set the SR afterwards to the fixed value $2300, but save the old
     SR if possible before the blocking (say onto the stack) and then
     load it back again afterwards. If it is imperative that a reset
     of the SR is to take place irrerspective of the old SR, then set
     the interrupt mask to zero and (!I)not(!i) to three, so for instance
     MOVE #$2000,SR instead of MOVE #$2300,SR. The Atari operating
     system then automatically looks after converting the mask value
     to 3, while the mask remains on 0 for the Mac; because otherwise
     nothing works any more.
!item (!B)Hardware accesses(!b)
(!nl)
     Before programming certain hardware registers directly (e.g. the
     Centronics port for printing), one should check the (!link [_MCH][Cookie, _MCH]) cookie.
     If its value is $FFFFFFFF (dec. -1), then it means that (!I)no(!i)
     Atari hardware is present (so that the program is running on the
     Macintosh, for instance) and therefore one shouldn't even try to
     access the hardware since there may well be RAM there, which of
     course may (!I)not(!i) be altered by such accesses.
!item (!B)Supervisor-mode(!b)
(!nl)
     Since multitasking operating systems such as MultiTOS and MagiC
     have came into use, no program should arbitrarily change the
     supervisor stack pointer, say to obtain a larger stack, as this
     could lead to incalculable system crashes (on the PCI Macs, for
     instance, a very large supervisor stack is required: at least
     8 MB, but in some circumstances even 24 MB - only the operating
     system can know this and install it correctly). (!B)Important:(!b) To
     get into the supervisor-mode, (!I)never(!i) use the (!nolink [GEMDOS]) function
     Super, but use Supexec from the (!nolink [BIOS]) instead. Only Supexec
     can ensure that a sufficiently large supervisor stack will be
     used.

!begin_node The shutdown process in MagiC Mac
!label Shutdown in MagiC Mac

Under (!link [MagiC Mac][MagiC Mac specifics]) the shutdown process will be taken on by the program
'shutdown.prg'; if this was able to terminate all currently active
(Atari) programs, then (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac itself will be terminated as well.
Some programmers might find it of interest how one can terminate
(!nolink [MagiC]) Mac (!I)without a query.(!i) This can be done in two steps:

!begin_itemize !short
!item Switch to the Macintosh-mode (with modeMac)
!item Execute the Mac routine (!I)ExitToShell.(!i)
!end_itemize

(!B)In Pure-C this could look as follows, for instance:(!b)

!begin_verbatim
  static pascal void ExitToShell (void) 0xA9F4;
  MgMcCookie *mgmc;
  ...
  ...
  get_cookie ("MgMc", &mgmc); /* Pointer to MgMc cookie structure    */
  mgmc->modeMac ();           /* Switch to Mac-mode                  */
  ExitToShell ();             /* Terminates MM at once without query */
!end_verbatim

This information could be important if you want to program your own
shutdown.prg.

!begin_node XCMDs under MagiC Mac

XCMDs are small external code modules for (!I)Macintosh(!i) applications.
As a rule these can be created fairly easily with the development
tools under MacOS (e.g. with Metrowerks' (!I)CodeWarrior(!i) or Symantec C).
As of version 1.2.2 (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac also permits the simple use of such code
modules by programs that run under MagiC. This greatly simplifies the
development of programs or drivers that want to use the Macintosh
functions, as these portions can then be created with a Macintosh
compiler, rather than having to recreate the interfaces laboriously
under an Atari development system.

An example of such a XCMD can be found in the (!I)'Demo XCMD'(!i) folder of
the original (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac documentation. The created module can then
just be placed in the (!I)(!nolink [MagiC]) Mac XCMDs(!i) folder. This folder must lie
in the same directory as the (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac application. At the launch of
(!nolink [MagiC]) Mac this folder is searched through for files with the filetype
'xCmd' and the XCMD resources contained in it loaded and executed.
These XCMDs can then register themselves with (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac and so become
available for (!nolink [MagiC]) programs.

(!B)An application is shown by the Pure-C program in the 'MGMC_API' folder
of the original (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac documentation(!b). This shows how easily an
installed XCMD can be opened and called. The functions offered here
by the cookie (xcmdMgrPtr) go automatically into the supervisor-mode
if required and switch to the Mac environment (with callMacContext),
and also  (!nolink [control]) parameter passing. The call of the XCMD functions
in this way is therefore permitted only when the Atari-mode is active
and if the call is not made from an interrupt.

If the XCMD functions are to be called from interrupts or in Mac-mode,
one can use 'xcmdMgrPtr->getAdr' to get the entry address of the XCMD
dispatcher and then jump to it directly.

Further information for XCMDs can be found in the source text
'Demo XCMD.c' of the original (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac documentation.
!end_node



!begin_node Cooperation between MagiC and the MacOS

(!nolink [MagiC]) Mac hooks itself directly into all interrupt vectors that the
Macintosh uses. If MagiC is running and a hardware interrupt occurs,
(!nolink [MagiC]) Mac switches the MMU back into the normal Macintosh-mode. At the
end of the IntrRoutine one will be switched back into the Atari-mode
and the programs running under (!nolink [MagiC]) will continue. As long as the
Mac-mode is active, (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac does (!I)not(!i) meddle further with the
Intr-processing, but does so only when the Atari-mode is active.

Whenever a switch is made from the Mac-mode back to the Atari-mode, a
check is made whether a given amount of time has passed (measured in
ticks; a tick is around 1/60s), in order to then perform periodic
tasks. These tasks are called Mac-tasks here.

(!B)Mac-tasks perform the following, amongst others:(!b)

!begin_itemize
!item Poll the Mac events (functions GetOSEvent or WaitNextEvent)
!item Evaluate [Command]-[Q] and [Command]-[W]
!item Evaluate external Apple events, e.g. Suspend/Resume (switch
     (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac into the background) and terminated externals
!item Cede CPU time to other Mac applications (with WaitNextEvent)
!end_itemize

The decision whether to use GetOSEvent or WaitNextEvent (WNE) for
polling the events can be set via 'Preferences' and also by a cookie
function. Only if WNE is used will CPU time be allocated to other
Mac applications as well.

Mac-tasks can be executed only if it is certain that no other MacOS
function is being processed at the time, since the MacOS is not
reentrant. (!B)Mac-tasks are therefore performed only if all of the
following conditions apply:(!b)

!begin_itemize
!item After the interruption (an interrupt or a modeAtari call) the
     Atari-mode will be active and the interrupt-level mask is zero,
     i.e. there is (!I)no(!i) other interrupt being handled (to ensure this,
     Intr-handlers that switch from Mac-mode into the Atari-mode have
     to use (!nolink [intrLock]) correctly, see below)
!item No routine in the Mac-context is being executed at the time
     (callMacContext)
!item (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac is (!I)not(!i) in the process of terminating itself
!end_itemize

!begin_node The MagiC Mac cookie

The (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac operating system [a port of MagiC to the hardware of the
Apple (Power) Macintosh] creates a cookie (!link [MgMc][Cookie, MgMc]), which points to the
following structure:

!begin_node MagiC Mac type conventions

Here follows a list of type conventions that play a role in connection
with (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac:

typedef char Boolean;
typedef char *Ptr, **Handle;
typedef unsigned char *StringPtr;
typedef void PixMap;
typedef Handle THPrint;
typedef void (*ProcPtr)(void);

typedef long cdecl (*GenProc) (short function, void *data);

the original documentation for (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac.

See also: (!link [Type definitions in MagiC][Type definitions])
!end_node


!begin_node mmc_flg1_bit4

The lower I/O area ($00FF8000-$00FFFFFF) is (!I)not(!i) present as such,
i.e. quite normal RAM may reside there, just as in any other place.
In that case (!I)no(!i) distinction will be made between ST-RAM and TT-RAM -
the whole of the RAM used by (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac, even that above 16 MB, will
be made available as (!B)ST-RAM(!b).

This means, of course, that in this case programs can make (!I)no(!i) I/O
accesses to this area! If this bit is cleared (not set), a program
can make accesses there nevertheless and count on a bus error if no
Atari-compatible hardware (such as (!I)McSTout(!i), say) is installed there.
!end_node



!begin_node mmc_flg1_bit5

The upper I/O area ($FFFF8000-$FFFFFFFF) is (!I)not(!i) accessible as such
(see MagiC Mac and Power-Macs); on accessing it one does (!I)not(!i) get a
bus error, but data from the Macintosh-ROM.
!end_node



!begin_node auxControl

This is intended for the HSMODEM driver: The WORD parameter on the
stack determines whether the ports are to be released (2 = close
completely, 0 = close, but hold DTR if necessary) or if reassignment
of the ports is permitted (value = 1). Between value-0 and value-1
the names (auxInPort, auxOutPort) may have changed.

(!B)Note:(!b) The call should be made in Atari supervisor-mode, the USP is
undefined.

!end_node



!begin_node callMacContext

This serves to produce the required Macintosh environment for calling
any MacOS routines. (!B)The routine must be called in Mac-mode and
in supervisor-mode and not from an interrupt.(!b)

For this one should pass on the stack the address of the routine that
is to be called as a subroutine in the Mac context. The normal user
stack of (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac is used for the called routine; in addition the
register a5 is loaded with macA5 and if virtual memory is active, a
switch is made to user-mode. As this function alters the stack, it is
(!I)not(!i) possible to pass parameters via the stack. The registers
d0-d2/a0/a1/a5/a7 are altered both at the call and also at the return
of the subroutine (although a5/a7 after return from 'callMacContext'
have the same values as before the call). The other registers are (!I)not(!i)
altered and can be used for parameter passing and returns.

The execution of this subroutine implicitly brings calls of intrLock
and intrUnlock with it, meaning that during this no Mac-tasks will be
processed, even if one switches into Atari-mode occasionally. To allow
processing of Mac-tasks despite of this, one can call the function
'giveTimeToMac'.

!end_node



!begin_node configKernel

This offers access to some settings that are otherwise accessible only
interactively from the Macintosh side. For this one passes as a rule
a function number in the (!I)function(!i) parameter and a pointer to a
variable in the (!I)data(!i) parameter, which has to contain the value to be
set before the call, or -1 in case no new value is to be set.

After the call the variable contains the current value. The settings
will be adopted in the 'Preferences' if nothing else is specified.
The functions:

!begin_xlist !short [Value]
!item [Value]
Description
!item [~]
~
!item [1]
(!I)data(!i) points to a byte that determines whether the 200Hz timer
is to be simulated by the MacOS timer. (!B)The following apply:(!b)
!begin_table [l l l]
0 !! = !! No
1 !! = !! Yes (default)
!end_table
!item [2]
Determines whether Mac background processes are to be called.
(!B)The following apply:(!b)
!begin_table [l l l]
0 !! = !! No
1 !! = !! Yes
!end_table
!item [3]
Determines whether the IDLE state for (!I)Powerbooks(!i) is permitted.
(!B)The followinng apply:(!b)
!begin_table [l l l]
0 !! = !! No
1 !! = !! Yes
!end_table
!item [4]
Similar to (1), for the flag 'UnlockMemOnMacSide' (see also
under atariModePossible): If this is non-zero, the memory
occupied by (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac for the TPA is released for offloading,
as long as virtual memory is active. Otherwise it cannot be
offloaded. This is not saved in the 'Preferences' at present.

!begin_node controlSwitch

Here Atari routines can hook themselves in with the XBRA procedure.
They are then called in Atari-mode (supervisor-mode) when one of the
specified events occurs. This is required, for instance, when an Atari
program wants to make use of certain Macintosh routines. For example,
a program using the sound routines of the Mac can be told in this way
when (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac has been terminated to close the sound channels and to
release the occupied memory.

The following values are passed in d0.W and on the stack (and must
also remain there):

!begin_xlist !short [Value]
!item [Value]
Description
!item [~]
~
!item [0]
(!B)Hide(!b)
(!nl)
Mouse and keyboard  (!nolink [control]) for (!nolink [MagiC]) are suspended, because a
Mac dialog is opened, for instance; in that case there should
be no output to the screen either (e.g. for interrupt routines)
as otherwise these could overwrite the Macintosh dialog
!item [1]
(!B)Show(!b)
(!nl)
The opposite of Hide

!begin_node getBaseMode

If getBaseMode is called in an interrupt, the function returns the
mode that existed at the instant before the interrupt was handled.
!end_node



!begin_node intrLock

This must be called before switching to Atari-mode from a Macintosh
routine that could run in an interrupt. In addition, one has to count
on the fact that before the switch a foreign stack is active which
does (!I)not(!i) belong to the address space of the Atari-mode.

Therefore one has to switch beforehand to a stack (see minStackSize)
from the Atari address space. After switching back to the Macinntosh-
mode one has to call intrUnlock, of course.

With the aid of these intr-semaphores one can recognize when the CPU
executes commands under (!nolink [MagiC]) in a non-interrupt state. This state
(!I)has(!i) to be recognized, because only then can the Macintosh background
processes and other Macintosh routines be called without risk by the
(!nolink [MagiC]) Mac kernel through its interrupt  (!nolink [control]) routines. (While the
interrupt routines or Macintosh routines are being processed, no Mac
routines may be called by the (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac kernel, because the MacOS is
not reentrant. During this time no Mac events are handled; even
[Command]-[W]/[Q] do not function at that time).

!end_node



!begin_node macAppSwitch

Here Atari routines can hook themselves in with the XBRA procedure.
They are then called in Atari-mode (supervisor-mode) when one of the
specified events occurs. This is required, for instance, when an Atari
program wants to make use of certain Macintosh routines. For example,
a program using the sound routines of the Mac can be told in this way
when (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac has been terminated to close the sound channels and to
release the occupied memory.

The following values are passed in d0.W and on the stack (and must
also remain there):

!begin_xlist !short [Value]
!item [Value]
Description
!item [~]

!item [0]

!end_node



!begin_node atariModePossible

This points to a byte indicating whether a switch from the Mac to the
Atari MMU-mode is possible at that instant (0=forbidden, 1=allowed).
So long as the Macintosh is running without virtual memory (VM) (also
without RAM-doubler), the 'modeAtari' call is always possible; however
if VM is active and also the 'UnlockMemOnMacSide' flag is non-zero,
then on switching from the (!nolink [MagiC]) to the Mac screen the memory occupied
by MM ((!nolink [MagiC]) Mac) for the TPA will be released for offloading.

However, as soon as the VM management offloads a block, the MMU tables
calculated by MM are no longer valid and must be calculated anew prior
to the next switch to the Atari-mode. This is not done automatically,
however, but only when switching back to the Atari screen. For this
reason interrupt and other asynchronous routines that are installed
under (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac by MacOS functions may (!I)not(!i) perform Atari-mode
switches under the described circumstances.

Atari programs that hook into the Atari vectors (e.g. the VBL vector
at $70) need not take all of this into account, since in cases when
the MMU tables become invalid the Atari interrupts will not even be
simulated any more. In cases where one should take further measures
before or after the status of the flags alters one can install also
a routine via macAppSwitch that then indicates this event with the
values 3 and 4 in d0.W).

!end_node



!begin_node modeAtari

Before this function can be called the following conditions have to
be fulfilled:

!begin_itemize
!item The Mac-mode must be active
!item The CPU must be in the supervisor-mode. Under virtual memory, Mac
     programs and also the Mac interrupt routines run in user-mode.
     If one wants to switch occasionally to the Atari-mode from
     there, one has to change to the supervisor-mode beforehand.
     See 'EnterSupervisorMode'.
!item The current stack must lie in Atari address space, else the CPU
     freezes immediately due to a double bus error if the program is
     running on a 68k computer - because then other areas, including
     the stack area, are no longer addressable. Please see also
     minStackSize for this.
!item atariModePossible must indicate that MMU switching is permitted.
     Otherwise, with MacsBug installed, the following message appears:
     'Fatal Error: Atari-mode currently not available (MMU tables
     invalid)'.
!end_itemize

Cookie and XBRA list
!end_node



!begin_node modeMac

This can be called at any time, also in interrupt routines, as long as
the program is in the Atari-mode and in supervisor-mode at the time.
After the call the whole Mac address space can be accessed.

The memory that starts in Atari-mode at address zero, starts in the
Mac-mode at the position to which (!I)atariZeroPage(!i) points. If a switch
was made from a normal Atari application to the Mac-mode with modeMac,
then only those MacOS routines may be called that may also be called
in an interrupt (see 'Inside Macintosh'); if necessary one also has
to place in register a5 the value from macA5. Other routines should
be called only with callMacContext, particularly those that use the
QuitDraw routines - if appropriate this has to be tried out. If a call
of (!nolink [callMacContext]) is required, this can be recognized often by the
fact that bus errors occur otherwise, or no texts appear in dialog
boxes etc.

!end_node



!begin_node versionOfMacAppl

With this one obtains the version identifier of the running (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac
application (i.e. the ID that can also be displayed in the Finder).
At last programs can adjust themselves to the MM versions!
!end_node



!begin_node giveTimeToMac

This serves for ceding time to Mac event handling of (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac if the
computer spends too long in Mac-mode (sensible from 1/60s onwards),
e.g. while waiting for completion of asynchronous processes.

(!B)'giveTimeToMac' can be called as often as desired(!b); the Mac events
are in any case only polled as frequently as set in the Preferences
(normal: every 1/60s, which is also the maximum frequency). In order
to call the routine, the complete Mac context must be fashioned, i.e.
the applications stack must be active and a5 set accordingly (this is
achieved for instance with callMacContext). The routine performs no
other actions that do not happen otherwise as well when the Atari-mode
is active and during this the Mac events are polled automatically in
turn. A specialty is that the routine does not evaluate a pending Quit
(!nolink [command]), so that the routine that calls 'giveTimeToMac' can assume
that it will be its turn again immediately (as long as a fatal error
does not occur).

!end_node



!begin_node minStackSize

This specifies the minimum size for the supervisor stack, in case a
program has to reserve such stack space itself (for example when a
callback routine is called from MacOS and this then wants to call a
routine in Atari-mode, because one has to ensure there that the SP
when switching to the Atari-mode lies within the Atari address space
and this can only be effected with an own, local stack).

(!B)Warning:(!b) It is imperative that one keeps to this value, because though
5 kb suffice on the older 68k machines as a rule, on the newer PCI
PowerMacs over 12 kb is required when the network (Ether-Talk) is
active! However, it is best if one forgoes the creation of one's own
supervisor stack completely, to avoid such problems in the future. In
case of doubt one should contact the author of the (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac kernel!

!end_node



!begin_node ext

This offers various help functions of the (!nolink [MagiC]) Mac kernel. The call
has to be made from Atari-mode (user- or supervisor-mode). Calls from
interrupts are (!I)not(!i) permitted.

For this one passes a function number in the (!I)function(!i) parameter and a
pointer to possibly additionally required data in the (!I)data(!i) parameter.
On calling undefined function numbers the return value of the function
will always be -1. The functions:

!begin_xlist !short [Value]
!item [Value]
Description
!item [~]
~
!item [0]
(!B)extMax(!b)
(!nl)
(!I)data(!i) is unused (pass NULL!), the return will be the highest
       implemented function number.
!item [1]
(!B)extAlert(!b)
(!nl)
Displays a generic Mac dialog (alert). (!I)data(!i) points to a NULL-
       terminated string (255 characters maximum!) that is displayed
       in the dialog. (!B)Warning:(!b) Umlauts and other accented characters
       must have Mac codings. For newlines simply insert a CR. (!nl)
       Return value: Always zero.
!item [2]
(!B)extAUXOpenErr(!b)
(!nl)
Displays a Mac alert with a text (adapted to the language in
       use) that the serial port cannot be opened because it is
       occupied (is required by HSMODEM/MACM1). (!I)data(!i) is unused.
       Return value: Always zero.
!item [3]
(!B)extFSSpecToPath(!b)
(!nl)
Converts a Macintosh filepath to a (!nolink [GEMDOS])-conform path.
       (!I)data(!i) points to the following structure: First an FSSpec (see
       Mac docs), followed by a buffer with room for 256 characters.
       This buffer is filled by a C-string that describes a complete
       pathname, with which the file can be accessed via (!nolink [GEMDOS]) file
       functions. It may be a good idea later that this path goes via
       the pseudo-drive 'u:\', in which all currently present Mac
       drives are then available. One must also take into account that
       we are dealing with file and folder names that do not fit into
       the 8+3 scheme. (!nl)
       If we are dealing with a folder, then the path is terminated
       with '\' in any case. If a path cannot be obtained, say because
       none of the configured (!nolink [MagiC]) drives 'sees' the relevant folder,
       the function returns the value -2. On success, a 0 is returned.

!end_xlist

(!B)Warning:(!b) This function may take some time under certain circumstances,
as all the directories used by MM may have to be searched through;
therefore do not airily call it up continuously if you can avoid it!

!end_node



!begin_node extMac

Corresponds to 'ext', though the call must be made in the Mac context
(see 'callMacContext'). It is advantageous if, due to call of other
Mac functions, the program is already in the Mac-mode. Calls from
interrupts are not permitted as a rule.
!end_node


!begin_node stackLoad

(!I)stackLoad(!i) activates a new CPU stack (a7).

This is required when one wants to call a routine in the Atari context
from a Mac context during which an arbitrary CPU stack is active, i.e.
before a mode-change with 'modeAtari' has been performed. A switch to
another stack is necessary then, because the memory area that a7 is
currently using may be blanked out through the switch to Atari-mode,
which could lead to the CPU freezing (see also the relevant parts of
'Exceptions under MagiC Mac').

Instead of simply placing the a7 onto the new stack, one should use
'stackLoad'. Basically this function does the same thing, but it also
informs the MacOS about this (by setting some global variables). As a
result the MacOS does not check a7 periodically in the meantime. The
reason is because otherwise, with certain MacOS versions (prior to 7.5
and again as of 7.5.3), the MacOS would issue a stack overflow message
even though this has not occurred.

If virtual memory is active, this call also prevents this stack area
being offloaded, which could result in the computer freezing in some
circumstances.

Usage: In a0 one should pass a pointer to a MemArea structure (see
above). This must contain a pointer to the start (lowest address) of
the stack as well as its length (respect 'minStackSize'!). The routine
will destroy the registers a0 and a1 and sets a7 to the value of
<MemArea.start+MemArea.length>.
!end_node

!begin_node stackUnload
The inverse of 'stackLoad'. This is to be called if the stack that was
active previously is to be used again.

The routine destroys the register a0 (a7 receives again the value it
had before the stackLoad call).
