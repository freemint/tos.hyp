<h1><a name="Old_20foreword_20by_20Rolf_20Kotzian">1.2 Old foreword by Rolf Kotzian</a></h1>
<p>This hypertext serves as a reference work for the system
functions of the operating systems <a href="tos_main.html">TOS</a>, MultiTOS, <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> and <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> Mac.
As one can no longer expect a new edition of the 'Atari-Profibuch', it
is getting more and more difficult to obtain structured information
about the existing system functions. A well-structured hypertext for
ST-Guide can provide a remedy for this and I believe that this version
of the hypertext meanwhile will fulfill many requirements.
</p>
<p>As the original author, for various reasons, no longer had an
interest in maintaining this hypertext, I have taken over further
development from Version 3.10 onwards. <b>Unfortunately the Fairware
concept that I chose for this hypertext has proved to be a complete
flop.</b> As the development of the hypertext is linked not only with
a very high expenditure of time but also of money, and I cannot afford
to store several megabytes of data free of charge in my mailbox for
any length of time, future versions will only be available for payment
(and only directly from me). <i>Translator's note:</i> This changed
later and the hypertext is at present available free of charge under
the conditions described in <a href="gpl.html">The GNU General Public Licence</a>.
</p>
<p>Naturally it's obvious that I can only include information in
the hypertext that I know about. Anyone missing some particular
information can therefore assume first that I do not have it at the
present time or due to certain circumstances I have not yet got round
to including it in the hypertext. I am basically thankful to anyone
who can help me with any information, and in that way contribute to
make this hypertext as complete and up to date a reference work for
<a href="tos_main.html">TOS</a>/<a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> programming as possible. It should be clear that the
potentialities of an operating system can only be fully exploited in
programs when this is sufficiently documented - and this is just what
this project is intended to realize. In this connection a complete and
extensive documentation of the MiNT-library would be most desirable.
</p>
<p>I refer at this point specifically to the fact that the
information contained in this hypertext does not all originate from my
pen, but that an almost uncountable number of <a href="references.html">sources</a> have been
collated, sorted, revised and transformed into the hypertext format.
In this connection, my thanks go to <i>Volker Ritzhaupt</i> and
<i>Oliver Buchmann</i> (Application Systems Heidelberg), who made
available to me important sources of information (<a href="magic.html">MagiC</a>, <a href="emulators_magicmac.html">MagiC Mac</a> and
<a href="VDI_fundamentals.html#NVDI">NVDI</a>), as well as <i>Thomas Tempelmann</i> for energetic support for
the <a href="emulators_magicmac.html">MagiC Mac specifics</a>.
</p>
<p>I have attempted to take the greatest of care in the collation
of all information; however I can assume <i>no</i> guarantee for the
correctness of the information present in this hypertext. The author
can accept <i>no</i> liability for any damage or harm arising from
the use of this work. The reproduction of registered or trade names,
trade descriptions etc. in this work does <i>not</i> entitle anyone
to assume even without special identification that such names may be
used freely by anyone without regard to trade mark and related
legislation.
</p>

<p><i>Translator's note:</i> Most of the rest of this section no
longer applies as the hypertext is at present being distributed free
of charge under the conditions described in The GNU General Public
Licence.

<p><b>As mentioned above already, unfortunately the Fairware
concept for this hypertext has proved to be a complete failure.</b>
For this reason new versions are only available to those who pay and
only directly from me. Those who have not so far sent a contribution,
but are interested in a current version of the hypertext, may obtain
it for a <i>onetime</i> payment of 35.- DM. When an update appears
<i>no</i> further payment is required (though I will not turn down
any update donations ;-). Money can be transferred to the following
account:
</p>
<p><i>Data deleted! (Gerhard Stoll)</i>
</p>
<p>For payment I would ask you to note the reason for the payment
(e.g. '<a href="tos_main.html">TOS</a>-Hypertext') as well as including a complete and legible
address. Those with email facilities are advised to also notify me of
payment via this. Payment of the above-mentioned 35.- DM will register
you with me and you will receive the current version by return on an
HD floppy disk (<i>only</i> HD disks will be sent). Future versions
can then be ordered for a transfer to my acount of 5.- DM (for
diskette, postage and envelope), and are also available for
<i>download via the Internet</i> for registered users.
</p>
<p>All those interested should specify whether they wish to order a
mono or colour version of the hypertext. <b>If this is not stated, I
will send the monochrome version</b>. With the colour version you
should note the following: This contains graphics with up to 16
colours, which however are only displayed correctly with the ST-Guide
version dated 10.12.96. Apart from the difference between monochrome
and coloured illustrations, the mono and colour versions of the
hypertexts are, of course, fully identical, i.e. they contain the same
information.
</p>
<p>Normally one should assume that the Bundespost will deliver
letters. Besides delays, it has been said that letters and even
packages at times suddenly just disappear. For someone who has paid
the postage etc., this is, of course, very annoying. I ask for
understanding that I can do nothing in such cases, and will send off
the hypertext <b>only after a new transfer</b> of 5.-DM to my
account.
</p>
<p>Praise, criticism, suggestions and bug-reports can reach me by
mail to the following address:
</p>
<p><i>Data deleted! (Gerhard Stoll)</i>
</p>
<p><b>Information about the current version of the hypertex can
also be obtained via my homepage in the Internet. The URL is:</b>

<p><i>Data deleted! (Gerhard Stoll)</i>
</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> Due to lack of support by users, the status
of the hypertext has been changed once more. The <a href="tos_main.html">TOS</a>-hypertext is
neither Public Domain nor Freeware, and from Version 3.70 on also
<i>no longer</i> Fairware. Distribution via <a href="gemdos_structures.html#PD">PD</a>-collection disks,
CD-ROMs, via mailboxes and similar media is <i>not</i> permitted.
</p>
<p><b>In no way do I want to give the impression of only wanting
to make money with this project.</b> I certainly won't get rich from
this hypertext (and this surely applies also to virtualy all products
on the Atari market). But I am of the opinion that those who have used
this hypertext since Version 3.10 (and have made use of updates)
should think for a minute about the word <i>Fairware</i>, and the
(also financial) outlay of this project.

<p>Changes in distribution (as of: November 1998)
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;
</p>
<p>Due to the high expenditure of time in the development of this
hypertext I have have till now felt unable to make it available free
of charge. Recently the development has unfortunately come to
something of a standstill. Reasons:
</p>
<p>&#x2022; Job-related stress
<br>&#x2022; Changes in private life
<br>&#x2022; Increasing focus on the Macintosh
</p>
<p>As unfortunately no improvement is likely in this regard in the
near future, but I would still like to make life a little easier for
the remaining Atari programmers, the hypertext is from now on
downloadable <b>free of charge</b> via my homepage. <b>Warning:</b>
I retain the right to change this again at any time. So possibly later
versions of this hypertext will be available again only after payment.
Regarding payment: Those using the hypertext and finding it useful may
like to send me a contribution of some kind. The following account may
be used for this:
</p>
<p><i>Data deleted! (Gerhard Stoll)</i>
</p>
<p>With a contribution I would ask you to note the reason for it
(e.g. '<a href="tos_main.html">TOS</a>-Hypertext') as well as including a complete and legible
address.
