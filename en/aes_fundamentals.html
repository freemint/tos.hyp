<h1><a name="AES_20fundamentals">8.2 AES fundamentals</a></h1>
<p>The AES (Application Environment Services forms the highest level
of <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a>. It deals with all those parts of GEM that go above
elementary graphic output and input functions. As the AES works
exclusively with VDI and GEMDOS calls, it is completely independent of the
graphic hardware, of input devices as well as of file-systems.
</p>
<p>The AES manages two types of user programs: Normal GEM
applications with file extensions '.PRG', '.APP' or '.GTP', and desk
accessories with file extensions '.ACC'.
</p>
<p>Unless you are using a multitasking operating system such as
<a href="magic.html">MagiC</a>, MiNT or MultiTOS, the AES can only run one application and
six desk accessories at a time. Desk accessories (with an '.ACC'
extension) allow quasi-multitasking even with plain <a href="tos_main.html">TOS</a>: They are
usually special <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a> programs loaded (wholly or partially) at boot-up
from the root directory of the boot drive (normally C:\), which remain
in memory and can be called <i>at any time</i> from GEM (and some
TOS) programs by clicking on their entry in the first drop/pulldown
menu. In other words, desk accessories can be called and used while
another application is running and has its window(s) open, even with a
single-tasking operating system such as TOS. Note that this is not
real multi-tasking, as the main application is suspended while the
accessory is executing and only resumes when the accessory is exited.
</p>
<p>Unlike applications, desk accessories don't interact with the
user immediately; most just initialize themselves and enter a message
loop awaiting an <a href="evnt.html#AC_OPEN">AC_OPEN</a> message. Some wait for timer events or
special messages from other applications. Once triggered, they usually
open a window where a user may interact with them. Under TOS,
accessories should not use a menu bar and should never exit after a
<a href="menu.html#menu_register">menu_register</a> call. Loading of any resources should happen before the
accessory calls <a href="menu.html#menu_register">menu_register</a>, and these resources should be embedded
in the desk accessory rather than being post-loaded, as on TOS
versions earlier than 2.06 memory allocated to a desk accessory is not
freed at a resolution change; thus memory allocated with <a href="rsrc.html#rsrc_load">rsrc_load</a> is
lost to the system after a change of resolution with the early
TOS's.
</p>
<p>When a desk accessory is closed under TOS, it is sent an
<a href="evnt.html#AC_CLOSE">AC_CLOSE</a> message by the system. Following this it should perform any
required cleanups to release sytem resources and close files opened at
<a href="evnt.html#AC_OPEN">AC_OPEN</a> (the AES closes the accessory's windows automatically).
Following this it should reenter the event loop and wait for a later
<a href="evnt.html#AC_OPEN">AC_OPEN</a> message.

own <b>AES clones</b>; at present one can mention projects such as
<i>N.AES</i> and <i>XaAES.</i> Besides constant evolution one
may hope also for source texts of these GEM components.

<h4><a name="Startup-code_20for_20accessories">8.2.1.1 Startup-code for accessories</a></h4>
<a name="Accessories_2C_20Startup-code_20for"></a>
<p>To test whether an application was launched as a program or as a
desk accessory, one can proceed as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> If the register a0 has the value zero at program startup, then
we are dealing with a normal program launch.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Otherwise we are dealing with a desk accessory, and register a0
contains a pointer to the (incompletely) filled <a href="gemdos_structures.html#BASEPAGE">BASEPAGE</a>. The TPA has
already been shrunk appropriately (to the sum of basepage size and the
length of the three program segments), but a stack still has to be
created.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> With this information there is no problem in
creating the start- up code for a program in such a way that it
recognizes automatically how the application was launched, and to
continue the initialization appropriately. With most C compilers the
external variable <i>_app</i> in the startup code is initialized
automatically, which has the value 0 when the application was launched
as a desk accessory. This makes it possible to develop applications so
that they may be launched either as desk accessories or as normal
programs.
</p>

<br><a href="aes_about.html">About the AES</a> &nbsp; <a href="#Accessories_20in_20MagiC">Accessories in MagiC</a> &nbsp; <a href="gemdos_tpa.html">Program launch and TPA</a>
</p>
<h4><a name="Accessories_20in_20MagiC">8.2.1.2 Accessories in MagiC</a></h4>
<a name="MagiC_2C_20Accessories_20in"></a>
<p>Under <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a>, desk accessories are almost equal to programs.
Their windows are maintained at program changes. They may have menus
and desktop backgrounds, post-load programs, allocate memory,
open/close/ delete/copy files etc.
</p>
<p>As there is no longer any reason to close windows at program
changes, there is no <a href="evnt.html#AC_CLOSE">AC_CLOSE</a> message any more. The system does not
distinguish desk accessories from programs, apart from the fact that
they may not terminate themselves. As under GEM/2, accessories can
also deregister themselves in the menu, using the AES call
<a href="menu.html#menu_unregister">menu_unregister</a>.
</p>
<p>In place of accessories, under MagiC it is more sensible to use
applications that simply register one menu bar with one menu, and lie
in the APP autostart folder. These applications can be loaded when
required, and also removed again afterwards.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> As of MagiC 4, desk accessories can be loaded
also while the system is running (not just at boot-up). Furthermore
accessories can be unloaded by clicking on the corresponding accessory
entry in the first menu while the [Control] key is held down. One
disadvantage is that at present accessories may not perform <a href="gemdos_process.html#Pexec">Pexec</a> with
mode 104.

<h3><a name="The_20desktop_20window">8.2.2 The desktop window</a></h3>
<a name="Window_2C_20Desktop"></a>
<p>Of the available windows, the desktop or background window plays
a special role. It has the ID 0, occupies the whole screen area, is
always open and also cannot be closed. The <i>working area</i> is the
area below the menu bar. Only in this working area can other programs
output to the screen or open their own windows.
</p>
<p>Normally the working area of the desktop appears as a solid
green area (in colour resolutions) or as a grey raster pattern (in
monochrome operation). The <a href="#The_20screen-manager">screen-manager</a> attends to the screen redraws all on
its own; with a call of <i><a href="wind.html#wind_set">wind_set</a></i>, other application programs
can anchor any other object tree as a background. In that case too the
screen-manager looks after any required redraws of sections of the
image. Although this possibility is very alluring, there are several
reasons that point <i>against</i> the use of the desktop window; the
most important:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Even under a multitasking-capable <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a> (<a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> or MultiTOS),
there can be <i>only one</i> screen background. This should be
reserved for the program that can make the most use of it - as a rule
this is the desktop or a desktop replacement such as the Gemini shell,
Thing or Jinnee for instance.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To sum up: If possible, the desktop background should
<i>not</i> be used in your own programs.

<h3><a name="Data_20exchange_20via_20the_20GEM_20clipboard">8.2.3 Data exchange via the GEM clipboard</a></h3>
<a name="Data_20exchange_20via_20clipboard"></a>
<a name="Clipboard_2C_20Data_20exchange_20via"></a>
<p>To store files in the clipboard, one should proceed as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Delete all clipboard files that match the mask 'scrap.*' and
'SCRAP.*'. <i>Note:</i> The mask 'SCRAP.*' must be allowed for
because old programs knew nothing of alternative and case-sensitive
file-systems.
</li>
<li> Save the data to be stored in one or several formats.
</li>
<li> <a href="powerdos.html#Send">Send</a> the message <a href="evnt.html#SC_CHANGED">SC_CHANGED</a> to <i>all</i> applications in the
system and <a href="evnt.html#SH_WDRAW">SH_WDRAW</a> to the system shell.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The filename is <i>always</i> 'scrap.', the extension (suffix)
depends on the selected format here; if possible one should
<i>always</i> support one of the following standard formats:
</p>
<div align="left"><table border="0" class="UDO_env_table">
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Suffix</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Meaning</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">txt</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">ASCII text file, each line terminated with CR/LF</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>In addition one can support one or more of the following formats
(the receiver then has the option of using the option with the
greatest amount of information):
</p>
<div align="left"><table border="0" class="UDO_env_table">
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Suffix</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Meaning</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">asc</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">ASCII text file, each paragraph terminated with CR/LF</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">csv</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">ASCII file with comma-separated numbers</td>

  <td align="left" valign="top">TeX</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>The receiving program should first check which of the available
files contains the most information, and then use this file.
</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> Each of the files in the clipboard contains
the same information on principle, just in different formats. The text
processor <i>Papyrus</i>, for instance, imports 'scrap.rtf' only if
its own format 'scrap.pap' could not be found.
</p>
<p>It should be clear from the above explanation that only
<i>one</i> data object (though in different formats) can be present
in the clipboard at any time.
</p>
<p><i>Note:</i> A few old programs, such as First Word and First
Word Plus, are promiscuous and the clipoards they create automatically
are scattered all over the place - usually the directory they are
launched from. Some other applications may then use this clipboard
rather than the 'official' one on the boot drive!

<h3><a name="The_20object_20structure">8.2.4 The object structure</a></h3>
<p>Although the data structure of the object tree is not a tree in
the sense of a binary tree, it nevertheless possesses within a pointer
the logical chaining of a tree, with predecessors and successors
(generally called 'parents' and 'children' respectively). The speci
fication of parents and children is made via indices to an array.
</p>
<p>The tree structure of the individual objects can be illustrated
best with a simple example: A menu is composed at first of the menu
bar. This in turn contains several title texts. The title texts
therefore are contained directly in the menu bar, and are both
children of the object 'menu bar', so they move on the same
hierarchical level. The object menu bar refers with <i>ob_head</i> to
the first menu title and with <i>ob_tail</i> to the last menu title.
In the first menu title the pointer <i>ob_next</i> serves for
addressing the next menu title. Thus the chaining shows the following
structure:
</p>
<pre>      Menu bar:
   +---------+---------+--------+
   | ob_head | ob_tail | ...    |
   |    o    |    o    |        |
   +----|----+----|----+--------+
        |         +-------------------------+
        V                                   V
   +---------+---------+--------+       +---------+---------+--------+
   | ...     | ob_next | ...    |  ...  | ...     | ...     | ...    |
   |         |    o    |        |       |         |         |        |
   +---------+----|----+--------+       +---------+---------+--------+
   1st menu title |                          n-th menu title
                  +-----&gt; 2nd menu title
</pre>
<p>The actions that may be performed with a given object is
specified in <i>ob_flags.</i> The state of an object is held in the
entry <i>ob_state.</i> The entry <i>ob_type</i> determines the
object type.
</p>
<p>For an exact definition some objects need an additional data
structure such as <a href="aes_structures.html#TEDINFO">TEDINFO</a> or <a href="aes_structures.html#BITBLK">BITBLK</a>. In that case a pointer to this
additional structure will be stored in <i>ob_spec.</i>
</p>

objects <a href="aes_structures.html#OBJECT">OBJECT</a>:

<p>The high byte is used by the AES only for submenus. If the
highest bit of <i>ob_type</i> is 0x8000 and the bit <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#SUBMENU">SUBMENU</a> in
<i>ob_flags</i> is set, then the bits 8..14 specify which submenu is
coupled with the menu entry. Hence each application can have a maximum
of 128 submenus. <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> only reads the low byte from <i>ob_type</i>,
apart from the submenu handling. TOS reacts cleanly to unknown
object types (such as the purely MagiC types G_SWBUTTON etc.), i.e.
the objects are not drawn.

<p>In GEM/5, CROSSED makes the object draw in 3D:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If an object is both CROSSED and <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#SELECTABLE">SELECTABLE</a>, then it is drawn
as a checkbox.
</li>
<li> If it is CROSSED, <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#SELECTABLE">SELECTABLE</a> and an <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#RBUTTON">RBUTTON</a>, it is drawn as a

</li>
<li> If it is a button or a box and it is CROSSED, then it is drawn
as a raised 3D shape, similar to Motif.
</li>
<li> If a button is CROSSED and <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a>, a &quot;Return key&quot;
symbol appears on it (rather like NEXTSTEP).
</li>
<li> Boxes and text fields that are CROSSED and CHECKED appear

</ul>

<p>GEM/5 can be detected by calling <a href="vdi_inquire.html#vqt_name">vqt_name</a> for font 1. If
nothing is returned, GEM/5 is running.
</p>
<p>Recent FreeGEM builds contain a system based on the GEM/5
one, but extended and backwards-compatible. The DRAW3D state is used
instead of CROSSED:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If an object is both DRAW3D and <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#SELECTABLE">SELECTABLE</a>, then it is drawn as
a checkbox.
</li>
<li> If it is DRAW3D, <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#SELECTABLE">SELECTABLE</a> and an <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#RBUTTON">RBUTTON</a>, it is drawn as a
radio button.
</li>
<li> If a button is DRAW3D and <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a>, a &quot;Return key&quot;
symbol will be on it.
</li>
<li> If an object with a 3D border has the WHITEBAK state, then the
3D border will not have a black edge.
</li>
<li> If a radio button or checkbox has the WHITEBAK state, then it
will be drawn with a white background rather than in the colour used
by 3D objects.
</li>

<h3><a name="The_20quarter-screen_20buffer">8.2.5 The quarter-screen buffer</a></h3>
<p>The quarter-screen buffer is required by the <a href="#The_20screen-manager">screen-manager</a> to save the
contents of the menu background when drop-down menus drop down. The
'QSB' (the usual abbreviation) is also used for the display of alert
boxes. Normally its size should depend on the number of colour planes
and the size of the system font, but <i>not</i> on the total size of
the screen.
</p>
<p><b>A good formula would be:</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;500(characters) * space of one character * colour planes
</p>
<p>In 'ST High' resolution this would give a value of exactly 8000
(i.e. a quarter of the screen memory). Unfortunately in many cases the
AES is not so clever. The following table contains a summary of the
algorithm used by some GEM versions:

<p><b>Note:</b> The GEM versions 1.0 and 1.2 (i.e. up to and

colour graphics cards - one of several reasons why even with the use
of a special VDI driver under these GEM versions one can
<i>not</i> make use of colour graphics cards.

<a name="Window_2C_20rectangle-list_20of_20a"></a>
<p>To overcome the problem of windows that overlap each other, the
AES holds for each window a so-called <i>rectangle-list</i>; when
a window is partially obscured, <a href="gem_about.html">GEM</a> divides the visible portion of
that window into the least possible number of non-overlapping
rectangles, the details of which are then stored in the
rectangle-list. Thus the elements of this list form a record of the
currently completely visible working area of the corresponding window.
</p>
<p>To redraw a window (or its contents) one first inquires with the
function <a href="wind.html#wind_get">wind_get</a>(<a href="wind.html#WF_FIRSTXYWH_2C_20wind_get">WF_FIRSTXYWH</a>) for the first rectangle of the above
mentioned list. Then one checks whether this rectangle overlaps with
the screen area to be redrawn; then and only then one can redraw this
area with the use of <a href="vdi_control.html#vs_clip">vs_clip</a>.
</p>
<p>This method will be continued with all remaining elements of the
rectangle-list, until the height <i>and</i> the width of a rectangle
have the value zero.

<h3><a name="The_20screen-manager">8.2.7 The screen-manager</a></h3>

<p>When touching the menu area, the screen-manager automatically
ensures that the section of the screen occupied by the menu is saved
and later restored again (<a href="#The_20quarter-screen_20buffer">the quarter-screen buffer</a> is used for this).

<h3><a name="Toolbar_20support">8.2.8 Toolbar support</a></h3>
<a name="Toolbars_2C_20Redraw_20and_20update_20of"></a>
<p>From AES version 4.1 onwards the operating system supports
so-called toolbars. A toolbar is an <a href="aes_structures.html#OBJECT">OBJECT</a> tree that is positioned
below the information-line of a window (and above the working area)
which makes it possible to display buttons, icons etc. in a window.
</p>
<p>As already known from the window routines, the management of
toolbars is shared betwen the AES and the application. <b>Here the
AES is responsible for the following actions:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Adaptation of the X- and Y-coordinates of the toolbar when the
window is moved or its size is changed.
</li>
<li> Ensuring that the window is configured to the size required by
the window components and the toolbar.
</li>
<li> Adjustment of the toolbar's width to the width of the window.
</li>
<li> Redraw of the toolbar on receipt of a <a href="evnt.html#WM_REDRAW">WM_REDRAW</a> message.
</li>
<li> Sending of AES messages when the user activates an object of
the toolbar.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The application, on the other hand, must look after the
following:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Construction of an <a href="aes_structures.html#OBJECT">OBJECT</a> tree for the toolbar (in particulat
one has to ensure that all selectable elements of the toolbox have the
status <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#TOUCHEXIT">TOUCHEXIT</a>).
</li>
<li> Adjustment of the width of a toolbar object if this depends on
the width of the window (may be required when changing the size of the
window).
</li>
<li> Handling of <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#USERDEF">USERDEF</a> objects.
</li>
<li> Redrawing all objects whose appearance is to be changed. In
this case it is imperative that the rectangle-list of the toolbar is
inquired for and/or taken into account.
</li>
<li> Problems that arise in connection with the screen resolution
have to be solved. Thus, for instance, the height of an icon in the ST
Medium resolution can differ from the height of the icon in the TT030
Medium resolution.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>For supporting toolbars in your own programs, you should
respect the following points:</b>

<h4><a name="Redraw_20and_20updating_20of_20toolbars">8.2.8.1 Redraw and updating of toolbars</a></h4>
<p>For redraws of (parts of) the toolbar, one has to pay respect to
the rectangle-list as usual. As the previous <a href="wind.html#wind_get">wind_get</a> opcodes <a href="wind.html#WF_FIRSTXYWH_2C_20wind_get">WF_FIRSTXYWH</a>
and <a href="wind.html#WF_NEXTXYWH_2C_20wind_get">WF_NEXTXYWH</a> <i>only respect the working area</i> of a window, however,
two new parameters (<a href="wind.html#WF_FTOOLBAR_2C_20wind_get">WF_FTOOLBAR</a> and <a href="wind.html#WF_NTOOLBAR_2C_20wind_get">WF_NTOOLBAR</a>) were introduced, with whose
help the rectangle-list of a toolbar can be interrogated.
</p>
<p><b>A redraw of (parts of) the toolbar may be necessary in the
following situations:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> The toolbar contains user-defined objects (<a href="aes_fundamentals.html#USERDEF">USERDEF</a>'s).
</li>
<li> The status of an object in the toolbar was altered. The area to
be redrawn here consists of the size of the object plus the space
required for special effects (3D, shadowing, outlining etc.).
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Redraw is not necessary in the following cases, for
instance:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> The relevant window is iconified. The application does not have
to take on any management of the toolbar; this is only required at the
restoration of the iconification, the so-called uniconify.
</li>
<li> The toolbar present in the window is to be replaced by another
one. In this case a call of <a href="wind.html#wind_set">wind_set</a> with the opcode <a href="wind.html#WF_TOOLBAR">WF_TOOLBAR</a> and
the address of the new <a href="aes_structures.html#OBJECT">OBJECT</a> tree will suffice.
</li>
<li> The toolbar present in the window is to be removed. In this
case a call of <a href="wind.html#wind_set">wind_set</a> with the opcode <a href="wind.html#WF_TOOLBAR">WF_TOOLBAR</a> and NULL parameters
will suffice.

window- manager of the AES. In detail:
</p>
<a name="Toolbar_2C_20Tacking_20on_20a"></a>
<p><b>For tacking on a toolbar to a window</b>, it is sufficient
to call <a href="wind.html#wind_set">wind_set</a>(handle, <a href="wind.html#WF_TOOLBAR">WF_TOOLBAR</a>, ...) with the address of the
toolbar object tree. If this call is executed while the window is
open, then it is itself responsible for the correct calculation of the
height of the toolbar.
</p>
<a name="Toolbar_2C_20Exchange_20of_20a"></a>
<p><b>To exchange a toolbar for another one</b>, one can have
recourse to a call of <a href="wind.html#wind_set">wind_set</a>(handle, <a href="wind.html#WF_TOOLBAR">WF_TOOLBAR</a>, ...) with the
address of the new toolbar. If this call is executed while the window
is open, then it is itself responsible for the correct calculation of
the height of the (new) toolbar.
</p>
<a name="Toolbar_2C_20Removal_20of_20a"></a>
<p><b>To remove a toolbar from a window</b>, it is necessary to

call is executed while the window is open, then it is itself
responsible for the correct calculation of the height of the toolbar.
</p>
<p><b>In addition the following points have to be taken into
consideration:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> If a window is closed with <a href="wind.html#wind_close">wind_close</a>, then any toolbar present
will <i>not</i> be removed. At a later reopening the toolbar will be
in place once more.
</li>
<li> If a window is removed with <a href="wind.html#wind_delete">wind_delete</a>, then its link to a
toolbar will be dissolved.
</li>
<li> To be able to recognize mouse-clicks on toolbar objects, these
have to possess the status <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#TOUCHEXIT">TOUCHEXIT</a>. When such an object is clicked

<h4><a name="Problems_20with_20wind_calc_20in_20toolbar_20windows">8.2.8.3 Problems with wind_calc in toolbar windows</a></h4>
<a name="wind_calc_2C_20Problems_20with"></a>
<p>When applying the function <a href="wind.html#wind_calc">wind_calc</a> to windows that possess a
toolbar there are several problems to be taken into account:
</p>
<p>As this function is <i>not</i> passed a window ID (window
handle), the desired sizes cannot be calculated correctly when a
toolbar is present in the window. The reason for this is that, quite
simply, the AES in this case has <i>no information</i> about the
toolbar, and specially about its size.
</p>
<p>Hence the values returned by <a href="wind.html#wind_calc">wind_calc</a> in such cases have to be
further refined by the application. As the program can access the
relevant <a href="aes_structures.html#OBJECT">OBJECT</a> tree (and with this also the height of the toolbar),
this should present no problems. <b>In detail:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> When ascertaining the <i>border areas</i> of the window, the
height of the toolbar must be added to the height returned by the
function.
</li>
<li> When ascertaining the <i>working area</i> of the window, the
height of the toolbar must be added to the Y-value (<i>couty</i>)
returned by the function.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Besides the height of the actual object, the
height of the toolbar should include also the space requirement for
special effects (3D, shadowing, etc.).

<h3><a name="AES_20bindings">8.2.9 AES bindings</a></h3>
<a name="Bindings_20of_20the_20AES"></a>
<p>The AES is called via a single subprogram that is passed 6
parameters; these are addresses of various arrays that are used for
input/output communications. To call an AES function, the following
parameter block must be populated with the addresses of the arrays
described below:
</p>
<a name="AES_20parameter-block"></a>
<a name="Parameter-block_20of_20the_20AES"></a>
<pre>typedef struct
{
    int16_t *cb_pcontrol;  /* Pointer to control array */
    int16_t *cb_pglobal;   /* Pointer to global array  */
    int16_t *cb_pintin;    /* Pointer to int_in array  */
    int16_t *cb_pintout;   /* Pointer to int_out array */
    int16_t *cb_padrin;    /* Pointer to adr_in array  */
    int16_t *cb_padrout;   /* Pointer to adr_out array */
} <a href="aes_structures.html#AESPB">AESPB</a>;
</pre>
<p>The address of this parameter block (which lies on the stack)
must be entered in register d1, and subsequently register d0.w must be
filled with the magic value 0xc8 (200). With a TRAP #2 system call the
AES can then be called directly. For the
<b><i>Pure-Assembler</b></i> this could look like this, for
instance:
</p>
<a name="aes"></a>
<pre>                .EXPORT aes         ; Export function
                .CODE               ; Start of the code-segment

        aes:     MOVE.L 4(sp),d1    ; Address of the parameter blocks
                 MOVE.W #200,d0     ; Opcode of the <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a>

                .END                ; End of the module
</pre>
<p>There is no clear information available about which registers
may be altered. In fact, however, the corresponding routines in ROM
save <i>all</i> registers.
</p>
<p>Now to the individual arrays. With each field, designated input

<h4><a name="Sample_20binding_20for_20AES_20functions">8.2.9.1 Sample binding for AES functions</a></h4>
<p>The function 'crys_if' (crystal interface) looks after the
proper filling of the control arrays, and performs the actual AES
call. It is passed one WORD parameter in d0 containing the funtion's
opcode minus 10 multiplied by 4 (for faster table indexing); this
gives an index into a table in which the values for control[1],
control[2] and control[3] are entered for each individual AES
function.

int16_t crys_if (int16_t opcode)
{
        int16_t i, *paesb;

        control[0] = opcode;
        paespb = &amp;ctrl_cnts[ (opcode-10)*3 ];

        for (i = 1; i &lt; 4; i++)
                control[i] = *paespb++;

        <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#aes">aes</a> (c);
        return (int_out[0]);

} /* crys_if */
</pre>
<p>The table used for this could be built up as follows, for
instance:
</p>
<pre>.GLOBAL ctrl_cnts
.DATA

ctrl_cnts: .dc.b     0,  1,  0       ; <a href="appl.html#appl_init">appl_init</a>
           .dc.b     2,  1,  1       ; <a href="appl.html#appl_read">appl_read</a>
           .dc.b     2,  1,  1       ; <a href="appl.html#appl_write">appl_write</a>
            ...
            ...
            ...

<p>A fuller version is given in <i>The Atari Compendium</i> pp.
6.39-41. Note that the <a href="rsrc.html#rsrc_gaddr">rsrc_gaddr</a> call must be special cased in a
library if you want to use the crys_if binding to call the AES.
