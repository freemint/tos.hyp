<a name="Guidelines_2C_20Style"></a>
<p>If one looks at several GEM applications of the same
category, it soon becomes clear that some programs are easy to use
while others can be quite difficult. A text processor such as
<i>Papyrus</i>, for instance, will surely present few problems to
most users; quite in contrast to programs such as <i>Signum!2</i>,
which brings many users out in a sweat!
</p>
<p>Whether a program is easy to use depends greatly on the
construction of the user interface. This chapter tries to offer some
tips on the design of user interfaces, and deals with the following
points or aspects:
</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>All software developers are urged to follow the recommendations
made here or to orient themselves on typical GEM applications.
Besides its functionality, the acceptability of a program (and hence
its sales prospects) depend to a large extent on the design of its
graphical user interface (GUI).
</p>
<p>Examples of errors in GUI design or poor user guidance can be
found in http://www.iarchitect.com/mshame.htm.

</p>
<h3><a name="Dialog_20boxes">10.2.1 Dialog boxes</a></h3>
<a name="Dialog_20boxes_2C_20Creation_20of"></a>
<p>During the construction of dialog boxes a software developer
should adhere to both an inner and outer consistecy, i.e. he should
orient himself on typical dialog boxes of other programs (outer
consistency) and also ensure that within an application the dialog
boxes have a uniform appearance (inner consistency).
</p>
<a name="Dialog_20boxes_2C_20Design_20rules_20for"></a>
<p><b>The following list names some exemplary aspects that should
be paid regard to in the design of dialog boxes:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Similar structure of all of an application's dialog boxes
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Similar structure of dialog boxes of all applications if
possible
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Each dialog should handle a partial task complete in itself
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Use uniform buttons for the same actions
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Split information into logical blocks
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Omit superfluous information
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Do not use too many objects on one plane
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Clearly differentiate between activating and indicating
elements
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Use special effects and colours very sparsely and deliberately
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition one should think very carefully about which type of
dialog is to be used for which purpose. Here one can differentiate
between the following dialog types:
</p>
<a name="Dialog_20boxes_2C_20Alert"></a>
<a name="Alert_20boxes"></a>
<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2045_en.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="288" height="171"></p>
<p><b>Alert boxes</b> are used to inform the user about important
events, or to ask questions that need to be answered. They inform
briefly about the state of affairs, and if appropriate offer several
alternatives of how to react to them. The above illustration shows an
alert box which has been placed in a window to actively support
multitasking.
</p>
<a name="Dialog_20boxes_2C_20modal"></a>
<a name="Modal_20dialog_20boxes"></a>
<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2044_en.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="320" height="202"></p>
<p><b>Modal dialog boxes</b> should be used always when the user
has to be, or should be, forced to take immediate action. The user can
only continue to use the application when he has left the
corresponding dialog. The above illustration shows a modal dialog box,
which has been placed in a window to actively support multitasking.
Modal window-dialogs can be recognized by the user by the <b>missing
Closer</b> in the window components.
</p>
<a name="Dialog_20boxes_2C_20nonmodal"></a>
<a name="Nonmodal_20dialog_20boxes"></a>
<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2043_en.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="336" height="204"></p>
<p><b>Nonmodal dialog boxes</b> should be used whenever this is
possible. Such a dialog exists like a window parallel to the actual
program, and offers maximum flexibility to the user. The illustration
above shows a nonmodal dialog box, which has been placed in a window
to actively support multitasking. Nonmodal window-dialogs can be
recognized by the user by the <b>presence of a Closer</b> in the
window components.
</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> So that all applications can make
unrestricted outputs to the screen at any time in a multitasking
environment, it is imperative that all alert and dialog boxes of a
program are placed in windows. Some applications (e.g. the resource
editor <i>Interface</i>) allows one to switch at any time between
conventional dialogs and window-dialogs; however this option should be
offered only when it is really necessary. In view of future, or
already existing, multitasking-capable TOS versions, conventional
dialogs will only play a subordinate role.

</p>
<h3><a name="Help_20systems">10.2.2 Help systems</a></h3>
<p>With increasing complexity of software there is also an
increasing need for active user support with a carefully impemented
help system.
</p>
<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2042_en.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="384" height="450"></p>
<p>Besides the <i>relief of long-term memory</i> such a system
should answer the following four questions for the user:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Where am I?</b>
</li>
<li> <b>What can I do here?</b>
</li>
<li> <b>How did I get here?</b>
</li>
<li> <b>Where can I go to, and how do I get there?</b>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A very good help system is offered, for instance, by the
relational database <i>Phoenix</i> from Application Systems
Heidelberg (and there are similar offerings by <i>Pure-C</i>,
<i>Grismo</i>, <i>ST-Guide</i> or <i>1st Guide</i>).
</p>
<a name="Help_20systems_2C_20Functioning_20of_20the"></a>
<p>In principle such a system works as follows: The desired
information is displayed in a window, and through visually emphasised
<b>cross- references</b> a mouse click allows further information for
given themes to be obtained at any time. Via a table of contents it is
possible to jump to a given theme (as in a book), and an index allows
targeted search for a given item of information.
</p>
<a name="Help_2C_20context-sensitive"></a>
<a name="Context-sensitive_20help"></a>
<p>Above all, there is real merit in a <b>context-sensitive help
system</b>: This term is understood to cover the provision of helpful
explanation referring to the momentary situation.
</p>
<p>For instance, if a window or a dialog box is open, then calling
the help system brings up an explanatory text for just this window or
dialog box.
</p>
<a name="Help_20system_2C_20Requirements_20for"></a>
<p><b>During the development of a help system for an application
the following points should be taken into account:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> <i>Every</i> dialog box should contain a 'Help' button, which
when activated makes information about exactly this dialog appear.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <i>Every</i> error message should contain a 'Help' button,
which when activated explains to the user why this error has arisen,
and how it may be remedied
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> If a window of the application (and no dialog box) is open,
then a help message for this window should be output. In this context
one should note that the functioning of the help system itself must be
explained!
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> If no windows or dialog boxes are open, and also no objects
(say icons) of the application are selected, then a general help to
the program should be displayed when a suitable menu entry is selected
or the [Help] key is pressed.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2041_en.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="384" height="249"></p>
<p>Every help text should contain at least the following
information:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> To which object does the help refer (window, dialog box or icon
etc.)?
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Which actions can be performed on or with this object?
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="Help_20systems_2C_20Encouragement_20for"></a>
<p>The fear expressed by many software developers that a good help
system supports or encourages <b>piracy</b>, though understandable,
should not be the reason to punish honest users.

</p>
<h3><a name="Mouse_20clicks_20and_20shapes">10.2.3 Mouse clicks and shapes</a></h3>
<p>Even a relatively unpretentious object as the mouse pointer has
an important meaning in a system with a graphical user interface. Both
the number of mouse clicks and the shape of the mouse pointer are of
particular interest to the user of a program.
</p>
<p>It has become customary to assign a given shape to the mouse
pointer depending on the operation to be performed; in detail:
</p>
<a name="Mouse-shapes"></a>
<a name="Mouse-shape_2C_20Meaning_20of"></a>
<div align="left"><table border="0" class="UDO_env_table">
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Shape of mouse pointer</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Meaning</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Arrow</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">General operation (default)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Bar or block</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Text input</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Bee or hourglass</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">The computer is busy with an operation, and</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">the human user cannot do anything during</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">the execution of this action</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Pointing finger</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Selection or dimensioning</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Open hand</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Moving or positioning of objects</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Crosshairs, thin</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Drawing or selection</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Crosshairs, thick</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">No fixed meaning</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Crosshairs, outlined</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">No fixed meaning</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>In addition the mouse pointer can be completely switched off as
well; this is useful, for instance, when executing drawing operations,
to avoid pixel rubbish accumulating. In special cases, the shape of
the mouse pointer can also be defined freely; in that case, however,
the shape of the mouse pointer should match the current situation.
</p>
<a name="Mouse-shape_2C_20Rule_20of_20thumb_20for"></a>
<p><b>As a rule of thumb, outside the working area of its own
window the mouse pointer should always take the shape of an arrow.</b>
</p>
<a name="Single-click"></a>
<a name="Click_2C_20Single-"></a>
<p>There are some things to report about the <b>number of mouse
clicks</b> as well. A single-click generally serves to select certain
elements. These can be elements of a dialog box (checkbox, radio
button, etc.), icons on the desktop of a shell, and also the
components of a window. In many cases a single-click can also trigger
further actions. For example, if the mouse button is held down, then
objects such as icons or windows can be dragged to another location,
or it is possible to select a whole group of objects.
</p>
<a name="Double-click"></a>
<a name="Click_2C_20Double-"></a>
<p>A <b>double-click</b> usually initiates a special operation;
the desktop, for instance, launches a program if its associated icon
is double- clicked on.
</p>
<a name="Clicks_2C_20Multiple"></a>
<a name="Multiple_20clicks"></a>
<p>In principle, besides single- and double-clicks of the mouse,
there are also <b>triple- or quadruple-clicks</b> available. But it
is strongly recommended to avoid these variants, as many people might
have major problems performing the corresponding number of mouse
clicks in a given time interval.
</p>
<a name="Mouse_20clicks_20and_20key-presses"></a>
<p>Last but not least one can use <b>mouse clicks</b> also <b>in
associationg with the keyboard</b> ([Alternate], [Control], [Shift]):
A mouse click in combination with a [Shift] key generally ensures that
further objects can be selected. In the shell <i>Gemini</i>,
double-clicking on an icon while holding down the [Alternate] key
opens a window containing the directory belonging to this icon. With
the alternative desktop <i>Thing</i>, holding down [Alternate] while
double-clicking on a desktop icon of an application or file (but not a
drive or folder) again opens the window of the relevant directory,
with the entry matching the icon preselected (inverse video).

<h3><a name="Menus_20and_20menu_20bars">10.2.4 Menus and menu bars</a></h3>
<a name="Menus_2C_20Design_20of"></a>
<p>To a large extent, the design of the menus is responsible for
the clarity and user-friendliness of an application. Therefore every
software developer should take enough time to create these in a
sensible and appealing manner.
</p>
<a name="Short-term_20memory_2C_20Capacity_20of"></a>
<p>As already mentioned, the <b>capacity of short-term memory</b>
is restricted. For this reason a menu bar should not offer more than
seven menu entries, if possible; otherwise the user has to glance at
the menu bar several times to be able to decide what he wants to
select. The following illustration shows the main menu bar of the
relational database system <i>Phoenix</i> in its English version:
</p>
<pre>  MANAGER  File   Edit  Process  Report  Parameters  Options  Help
</pre>
<a name="Menu_20bar_2C_20Standard_20make-up_20of"></a>
<p>Both the menu bar as well as the menus contained in it should
have a <b>standard make-up</b>, so that the user feels 'at home'
immediately after the launch of a program. The first menu from the
left should always carry the <i>name of the current application</i>;
this has the inestimable advantage in a multitasking environment of
being able to identify the active application immediately by a quick
glance at the menu bar.
</p>
<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2040_en.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="192" height="266"></p>
<p>The second menu title should always be named <i>File</i>, and
offer menu entries that deal with various aspects of input and output.
The lowest entry of this menu should always offer the option of
quitting the program.
</p>
<a name="Menus_2C_20Sub-groups_20in"></a>
<p>As one can see in the above illustration, individual entries
within a menu can be collected together in <b>logical subgroups</b>
separated by fixed or dashed lines, which contributes greatly to
clarity and acceptance by the user.
</p>
<a name="Menus_2C_20Assigning_20keyboard_20shortcuts_20in"></a>
<p><b>Note:</b> In assigning shortcuts in menus, take care not to
duplicate any of them <i>in the complete set of menu entries</i> and
also within any of the non-modal dialogs. Furthermore, avoid using
accented characters, since these may not be present on keyboards used
in countries other than that of the original programmer (Example:
Umlauts [Ä], [Ö], [Ü] and [ß] are only present on German
keyboards, and similar restrictions apply for French, Spanish or
Swedish etc.)
</p>
<p>Also remember that while [Control] combinations will use a
modified ASCII-code of the character key to execute the menu event,
[Alternate] combinations cannot do this and have to use the scancode;
however, the keyboard layouts in some countries differ in a few keys
(for instance, the [Y] and [Z] keys are transposed in English and
German-language keyboards, and the French ones have other
differences). It may thus be impossible to use some of these
characters together with [Alternate] successfully as shortcuts in many
programs when run on keyboards in languages other than that of the
programmer without changing and then recompiling the program source.
<i>Just changing the shortcut in the RSC file or program file will
not work!</i>
</p>
<a name="Menus_2C_20Three_20dots_20in"></a>
<p><b>Three dots</b> following a menu entry indicate that after
selecting this entry a dialog box (or file-selector) will open; the
user can then attune himself to this, and move the mouse pointer to
the middle of the screen, for instance, while the dialog is built up.
</p>
<p>Further frequently used menu titles are <i>Edit, Parameters,
Options</i> and <i>Help.</i> The first should always lie to the right
of the <i>File</i> menu, the last should always be placed at the
right end of the menu bar.
</p>
<a name="Menu_20titles_2C_20Demarcation_20of"></a>
<p>Each title should start with a capital (upper case) letter (the
name of the program at far left should always be completely in
capitals), consist of a single word only, and as <b>demarcation to
other titles</b> always have a space character to both its left and
right.
</p>
<a name="Menus_2C_20context-sensitive"></a>
<a name="Context-sensitive_20menus"></a>
<p>In addition, menu entries should always have a
<b>context-sensitive configuration</b>, i.e. an entry may only be
selectable if this is possible or sensible at the current situation of
the program. Thus, say, there is no point of calling the menu entry
<i>Save</i> when there is nothing to be saved. The same applies for
an entry <i>Close</i>, which should be selectable only if a window or
a dialog exists that can be closed. Such non-selectable menu entries
should be displayed 'greyed out' (in light type).
</p>
<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2039.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="254" height="227"></p>
<p>Apart from the conventional menu bar, some further and
interesting possibilities exist to allow the user to make selections.
Thus many programs (e.g. the shells <i>Thing</i> or <i>Ease</i> -
see illustration above) make <b>popup-menus</b> available to the user
to facilitate fast selection between various alternatives or perform
an operation.
</p>
<a name="Menu_2C_20Advantage_20of_20a_20popup-"></a>
<a name="Popup-menu_2C_20Advantage_20of_20a"></a>
<p>The main advantage of a popup menu lies in <b>shortening mouse
movements</b>. The menu simply appears at the screen position where
the mouse click was performed (usually with the right mouse button).
In implementing popup-menus one should ensure that these always appear
complete on the screen (long popup-menus can often be scrolled).
</p>
<a name="Menus_20in_20windows"></a>
<p>Last but not least there is the possibility to place a <b>menu
bar in a window</b>. This method offers many advantages: First of all
the main menu bar can be relieved in this way and so allow a much
clearer layout, secondly it makes possible building up an application
in a much more logical way; all operations affecting a given window
wander into the window menu, all others into the global menu bar.
</p>
<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2038.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="456" height="289"></p>
<a name="Menus_2C_20scrollable"></a>
<p>As one can not only move windows on the screen but, generally,
also change their size, it is possible that not all titles of a window
menu are visible. Hence some programs allow the menu bar to be
<b>scrolled</b>. This applies, for instance, to the text editor
<i>Grismo</i> or the resource editor <i>Interface.</i>

<h3><a name="Visual_20and_20acoustic_20feedback">10.2.5 Visual and acoustic feedback</a></h3>
<a name="Acoustic_20feedback"></a>
<a name="Visual_20feedback"></a>
<a name="Feedback_2C_20acoustic"></a>
<a name="Feedback_2C_20visual"></a>
<p>When working with a computer, the human user is dependent on
visual or acoustic feedback to retain the feeling at all times of
being in control of the task being perfomed, or being able to grasp the
current state of the process.
</p>
<p>GEM offers a multitude of possibilities for procuring a sense
of feedback to the user. Thus, for instance, menu titles or icons are
displayed in inverse video when the user selects them with the mouse.
</p>
<p><b>Acoustic feedback</b> is particularly useful in connection
with error or alert messages, which can be displayed in dialog boxes.
</p>
<p><b>Visual feedback</b> should be used always when the user
selects objects on the screen, or initiates a task with a long
processing phase. The user may never be left uncertain which operation
is being performed at the time, and how far this has progressed.
</p>
<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2037_en.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="272" height="328"></p>
<p><b>Graphical displays</b> (such as an advancing progress-bar
shown in the above illustration, for instance) are to be preferred to
textual ones for this, as the latter first has to be 'decoded' by the
user.
</p>
<p>Visual feedback is provided, for instance, by the relational
database system <i>Phoenix</i>, to inform the user of the state of
the inquiry; the shell <i>Gemini</i> (and many other programs) use
this method to show the user how the formatting of floppy disks is
progressing, and the text editor <i>Grismo</i>, amongst others,
inverts the cross-references of its help system when the user
activates them with the mouse.

</p>
<h3><a name="Selections">10.2.6 Selections</a></h3>
<p>'Selection' is understood to be the choosing of one or more
objects. On the desktop, for instance, one can select the files in a
drive window with a mouse click, [Shift]-mouse click or by drawing up
a rubber band box.
</p>
<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2036.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="372" height="350"></p>
<p>Basically the following conventions apply on the desktop:
</p>
<a name="Selection_20by_20mouse"></a>
<p><b>Mouse click:</b> A single left-click with the mouse selects
the object clicked on; objects that are already selected must be
deselected again by this action.
</p>
<a name="Selection_20by_20_5BShift_5D-mouse"></a>
<p><b>[Shift]-mouse click:</b> This adds the selected object to
the set of already selected objects (so previously selected objects
will remain selected). A [Shift]-mouse click on a selected object
removes this from the set of selected objects again.
</p>
<a name="Selection_20by_20rubber_20band"></a>
<p><b>Rubber band:</b> By drawing out a rubber band box
(left-click at the start of the area to be selected and holding the
button down drag the mouse pointer to the end-point), all objects
enclosed by this band will be selected; any objects already selected
must be deselected again by this action. In combination with the
[Shift] key the affected objects can be added to the set of selected
objects.
</p>
<a name="Realtime_20selection"></a>
<a name="Selection_2C_20Realtime"></a>
<p>A very useful type of selection is the so-called <b>realtime
selection</b>. This describes a procedure under which the selected
area is inverted already during the movement of the mouse pointer.
Many programs such as <i>Pure-C</i>, <i>Gemini</i>, <i>Everest</i>
or <i>Grismo</i> use this method of selection, and even scroll the
contents of the window automatically when the edge of the window is
reached.

<h3><a name="Special_20effects">10.2.7 Special effects</a></h3>
<p>Particular care is required for using colours, text attributes
etc. Usually the motto <b>Less is more!</b> applies here.
</p>
<p>One cannot provide here a patent recipe, but only the suggestion
that one should orient oneself on examplary application models.
</p>
<a name="Colour_2C_20Subjectivity_20of"></a>
<p>Particularly when using colours, software developers should keep
at the back of their minds that <b>human colour sense</b> is very
subjective; from this follows that it should be possible for the user
to set the colours in a way he finds agreeable.
</p>

<p>An exemplary application in this respect is the relational
database system <i>Phoenix</i> by Application Systems Heidelberg, for
instance, which is illustrated above. Here the user can configure
freely almost every aspect of the user interface.
</p>
<a name="Text_20attributes_2C_20Use_20of"></a>
<p>In text documents one should take care not to use too many, or
mixed text attributes (effects such as bold, italic, underscored,
shadowed, light or outlined etc.) at the same time. Here too the motto
<b>Less is more!</b> applies. But this statement cannot be applied
across the board: There are cases where the use of several attributes
at a time can not just be tolerated, but is recommended. In a
<b>hypertext system</b>, for instance, the <b>cross-references</b>
must be made particularly clear to the user. On nearly all platforms
it is standard to display these cross- references underscored, and if
possible also in colour. This has the advantage that text passages
that use a simple attribute can still be differentiated from the
cross-references.
</p>
<p>Absence of a patent recipe leads to uncertainty in many
developers which culminates in forgoing special effects or colours
completely. <b>But that missess the whole point!</b> Colour, sensibly
used, can not just increase clarity appreciably, but also drastically
increase an appli cation's attractiveness. However, developers should
also keep in mind that some users may be working in 2-colour
(monochrome) resolutions and ensure that their program is still usable
under those conditions.
</p>
<p>To sum up: Special effects (of whatever kind) should be used in
a premeditated and sparse manner.
</p>
<a name="User-testing"></a>
<a name="Testing_2C_20User-"></a>
<p>During the development of a software product the programmer
would do well to include a typical user as soon as possible in his
work <b>(user- testing)</b>, and to orient himself on model programs.
The most sensible thing is to make all ticklish points freely
configurable by the user!

<p>Note that shortcuts must not be duplicated within a menu
structure or a dialog, and some keyboard shortcuts can give rise to
<a href="guidelines_styles.html#Menus_2C_20Assigning_20keyboard_20shortcuts_20in">problems</a> when the application is run with a keyboard of a different
nationality to that used by the programmer. This is due to both the
absence of some characters on a keyboard as well as to different
keyboard layouts; the latter may affect [Alternate] combinations in
particular.

<h3><a name="Toolboxes">10.2.9 Toolboxes</a></h3>
<p>In some cases there is not enough room in an application's menu
bar or dialog boxes to accomodate all of the functions.
</p>
<p>Instead of overfilling the menu bar or squeezing too much
information into a dialog, one should fall back in such cases to a
<b>toolbox</b> or a <b>local menu bar</b> in windows.
</p>
<p>In nearly all cases this allows the corresponding functions to
be housed in the user interface - and in a clear manner into the
bargain.
</p>
<p>Toolboxes are generally offered at the top or right edge of a
window, but can also be movable.
</p>
<p><img src="bilder/gif/img2034_en.gif" alt="" title="" border="0" width="416" height="440"></p>
<p>Local menu bars and toolboxes are utilized by the resource
editor <i>Interface</i>, for instance, shown above. It can be useful
if a toolbox can be <b>hidden</b> temporarily, in order to be able to
show the actually more important information in the window; this is
permitted by the text editor <i>Grismo</i>, for instance.
