longer work in the next MagiC Mac version.

</p>
<h3><a name="General_20remarks_20about_20MagiC_20Mac">14.1.1 General remarks about MagiC Mac</a></h3>
<p>The core of the 'emulation' of the Atari environment on the
Macintosh lies in the reprogramming of the PMMU. Both Atari as well as
Macintosh programs assume that they will find certain variables (the
so-called <a href="bios_sysvars.html">system variables</a>) in the lowest 2 kB of the address space. However,
when an Atari program is running it expects other values there than,
say, the Mac operating system. The so-called kernel of MagiC Mac
makes sure that - depending on whether a Mac or an Atari routine is
running at the time - suitable system variables are present in that
lower address space. This is done with appropriate programming of the
PMMU, a coprocessor for memory management.
</p>
<p><b>So there are two MMU modes:</b> The Mac- and the Atari-mode.
By means of two routines one can switch back and forth between them.
Starting from taking the Mac-mode as the normal mode, the following
changes occur when switching to the Atari-mode:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> A memory block that was allocated somewhere on the Macintosh
heap is inserted from address $0 into the Atari address space. This
block is between 4 and 32 kB long and is guaranteed to hold only the
exception vector table and the documented <a href="bios_sysvars.html">system variables</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Address space from $00FF8000 to $00FFFFFF (and correspondingly
$FFFF8000 to $FFFFFFFF) is blanked out. On the Atari this is the I/O
address space, which is not normally available on the Macintosh (which
at most has RAM there).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>So that programs do not erroneously address this space as RAM,
if the Macintosh has some there, this blanking out leads to a bus
error at each access. It is however possible that special
Atari-compatible hardware has been <a href="xbios_sound.html#installed">installed</a> in the Macintosh,
whereupon this hardware then blends in this address space at the
relevant positions. <b>This means:</b> A program that recognizes that
it is running under MagiC on the Mac should <i>not</i> automatically
assume that no Atari hardware is present in the I/O area, but should
continue to check with a test access (by diversion of the bus error
vector) whether access to the module is possible.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> RAM that belongs neither to the TPA of MagiC, nor to the
MagiC OS or the kernel data and routines is not present in the Atari
address space, i.e. accesses outside the area specially reserved for
Atari programs lead to a bus error. This protects other Macintosh
applications better from faulty Atari programs. This protection
however works <i>only</i> with 68k machines, <i>not</i> with
PowerPCs!
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3><a name="MagiC_20Mac_20and_20Power-Macs">14.1.2 MagiC Mac and Power-Macs</a></h3>
<p>MagiC Mac naturally also runs on the new PCI machines from
Apple (Power Macintosh 7600, 8200, 8500 and 9500). <b>When using this
hardware the following points should be borne in mind:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> The address areas not used by MagiC, but present in the Mac
address space, can <i>not</i> be blanked out and so also <i>not</i>
protected from access. This means that accesses outside the TPA and
the program and heap area of MagiC Mac will <i>not</i> have bus
errors reported, as is the case with 68k computers.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> With the PowerMac models since mid-1995 the upper address area
is used for PCI cards and/or ROM. So on accessing the Atari I/O area
in $FFFF8000 - $FFFFFFFF one gets <i>no</i> bus errors but only
<b>undefined data</b>. Unfortunately this cannot be changed. It is
recommended therefore that programs access the I/O area only in the
range $00FF8000 - $00FFFFFF, to either check for the presence of
component modules (by making an access to them and checking whether
this leads to a bus error), or work with the hardware extension
<i>McSTout</i> in case it is also made available for the PCI-Macs.
Programs can recognize these circumstances by the state of bit 5 in
<a href="emulators_magicmac.html#UDO__25mmcookie_flgs1">Cookie.flags1</a>.

<h3><a name="Cookies_20under_20MagiC_20Mac">14.1.3 Cookies under MagiC Mac</a></h3>

<h3><a name="Filesystems_20under_20MagiC_20Mac">14.1.4 Filesystems under MagiC Mac</a></h3>
<p>MagiC Mac, just like MagiC, permits the incorporation of
alternative filesystems. At present the following systems are
supported:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> <b>FAT filesystems according to TOS conventions:</b> This
allows floppy disks as well as hard disks in the usual Atari format to
be accessed with all TOS functions (GEMDOS, but also e.g. <a href="About_the_BIOS.html#Rwabs">Rwabs</a>).
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <b>Mac filesystems:</b> As these do not have a FAT, access to
these drives is only possible via GEMDOS, but not via BIOS.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>The Mac filesystem under MagiC Mac:</b>
</p>
<p>As the GEMDOS functions are mapped directly to the Mac
filesystem functions for the most part, all file formats usable under
MacOS can be used under MagiC Mac as well, i.e. once one can 'mount'
a drive on the Mac, it is (or its folder contents are) also
installable under MM. <a href="references.html#Thanks">Thanks</a> to this one can also use CD-ROMs or
network drives without any further drivers in MagiC Mac as a rule.
MagiC Mac also allows the Mac- typical ejection of a floppy disk, for
instance.

<h3><a name="Restrictions_20of_20MagiC_20Mac">14.1.5 Restrictions of MagiC Mac</a></h3>
<p>MagiC Mac does <i>not</i> implement all functions that MagiC
offers for Ataris. AES, VDI and GEMDOS are implemented completely, but there are
restrictions with BIOS and BIOS. However it is possible to restore
some of the functionalities with add-ons such as <i>McSTout</i> or a
sound driver.
</p>
<ul>
Unimplemented or ignored functions with BIOS:
<br>Initmouse, Mfpint, Ikbdws, Jdisint, Jenabint, Giaccess, Offgibit, Ongibit,
Xbtimer, Dosound.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Additionally there are restrictions with some functions,
mainly in connection with the filesystem and the devices:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> The MIDI workstation is not usable at present unless the
hardware extension <i>McSTout</i> with MIDI option is <a href="xbios_sound.html#installed">installed</a>. It
may also be that MIDI will be realized in the future via one of the
serial ports of the Mac, so all that one can say is: Whether MIDI can
be used must be established by the user - a program cannot recognize
that by itself in practice. The same applies for Midiws.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> The IKBD workstation is not present
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> If Getbpb returns 0 it may be that a Mac-formatted floppy disk
is in the drive, which <i>nevertheless</i> can be accessed with the
file functions via drive A:
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> If a Mac-formatted disk is in the floppy drive, then Rwabs
will return an error ('Drive not ready'); the files on the disk can,
if necessary, be accessed <i>nevertheless</i> with the GEMDOS file
functions
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Drvmap also returns set bits for the drives that are Mac-
formatted and so are only addressable via GEMDOS and not with <a href="About_the_BIOS.html#Rwabs">Rwabs</a>
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Getrez always returns 2 (ST-High), so is unusable
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Setscreen can only alter the physical address if the user has
launched MagiC Mac in ST-resolution emulation mode (e.g. ST-High). To
recognize whether this is the case one should first attempt to alter
the address with Setscreen and then check with Physbase whether the address
let itself be altered.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Floprd, Flopwr, snd Flopver do not work if Mac-formatted disks
are inserted (implemented only as of MM 1.2.2). The bad sector list of
Flopver reports in case of error all sectors of the track as defective,
as the exact track can not be ascertained.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="xbios_drive.html#Flopfmt">Flopfmt</a> can format floppy disks as of MM 1.2.2, but only with
80 tracks, 2 sides and depending on the inserted disk, 9 or 18 sectors
per track. With the <a href="bios_cookiejar.html#Cookie_2C_20MgMc">MgMc cookie</a> one can check what kind of disk (DD or HD)
is in the drive. <b>Don't be surprised:</b> The Mac only offers a
function to format <i>all tracks at once.</i> Hence this is solved
with MM in such a way that a Flopfmt call for track 0 (or 79, depending
on where one starts) will format the whole disk and a Flopfmt call for
the remaining tracks will do nothing, so that the function returns
immediately with an error-code 0. In the case of a formatting problem,
an error is reported for all tracks. As a result the disk to be
formatted must be completely in order.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="xbios_interface.html#Rsconf">Rsconf</a>: The MPF-specific parameters are ignored
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="xbios_special.html#Puntaes">Puntaes</a> knows several modes, MagiC Mac is terminated if
necessary
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>

</p>
<h3><a name="Exceptions_20under_20MagiC_20Mac">14.1.6 Exceptions under MagiC Mac</a></h3>
<p>As on a real Atari, an Atari program running under MagiC Mac
can use the exception vectors, namely divert them. Actually the
program may use only the exception vectors between $0 and $400 for
this, not those to which the VBR points (because that points
elsewhere!). Those who do not adhere to this may run into difficulties
with later versions of MagiC Mac. Programs that use the <a href="bios_cookiejar.html#Cookie_2C_20PMMU">PMMU</a>, e.g.
<i>OUTSIDE</i> can <i>not</i> run under MagiC Mac.
</p>
<p><b>The following Atari interrupts are simulated by the kernel
at present:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> $070: Autovector interupt Level 4 (VBL)
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> $114: MFP interrupt 5 (200 Hz system timer)
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> $118: MFP interrupt 6 (IKBD). Actually only the event of key
presses and mouse movements is simulated here, i.e. the interrupt
handler obtains the specific type of the event in some other way than
on the Atari.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the Mac hardware, however, the interrupts may appear with
<i>different priorities</i>; consequently the interrupt mask of the
SR has other values to that on an Atari in some circumstances. The
vector at $400 (<a href="bios_sysvars.html#etv_timer">etv_timer</a>) will also be jumped to by the MagiC OS, of
course, as a subroutine of the interrupt handler for MFP interrupt 5,
in just the same way as on an original Atari.
</p>
<p>Likewise a program that would like to experience mouse or
keyboard events can use the BIOS function <a href="xbios_interface.html#Kbdvbase">Kbdvbase</a> to hook itself
into the event vectors in exactly the same way as on the Atari.
</p>
<p><b>Another important note about interrupts:</b> So that the
keyboard, mouse and timer work properly on a Mac, the interrupt mask
(in CPU register SR) must always be zero. On an Atari, on the other
hand, it normally stands at three. Programs containing code such as
MOVE #$2300,SR for instance, would put a Macintosh into a <i>sleep
state</i>, which only a reset can remedy. Those who want to alter the
interrupt mask only occasionally should do it this way (works equally
well on an Atari and Mac):
</p>
<pre>  MOVE SR,-(a7)    ; Store old SR
  ORI  #$0700,SR   ; Block all interrupts for a critical access
  ...
  MOVE (a7)+,SR    ; At end, restore old SR
</pre>
<p>Those who definitely want to return the computer to its basic
state should <i>not</i> use MOVE #$2300,SR but better MOVE #$2000,SR.
On the Atari the SR will then be increased to $2300 just before the
HBL interrupt routine. In this way the same code achieves te same
result on both machines.
</p>
<p>If interrupt or other asynchronous routines are <a href="xbios_sound.html#installed">installed</a> by
means of MacOS functions and then these functions are to switch from
the Mac- mode to the Atari-mode, then several things need to be
heeded, which are described in greater detail below:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Setting of a semaphore (see <a href="#intrLock">intrLock</a>/intrUnlock)
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Query whether an Atari-mode switch is even possible at the time
(see <a href="#atariModePossible">atariModePossible</a>)
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Deinstallation of the routine at the termination of MagiC Mac
(see <a href="#macAppSwitch">macAppSwitch</a>)
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Before switching into the Atari-mode one must ensure that the
stack pointer (SP) lies within the Atari address space, since
otherwise a double bus error arises and the CPU will come to a
standstill
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b>Note:</b> First: It may be that the call of the routine by
the MacOS occurs at a time when another Mac application is running, in
which case the current stack is <i>not</i> that of MagiC Mac.
Second: With the 68k machines, in Atari-mode only the address space of
the 2 TPAs, the lowest 32 kB, if necessary the I/O area as well as the
area of the MagiC Mac application is visible; other memory of MacOS
and other Mac applications is blanked out, and only bus errors will
arise if access is attempted. <b>To sum up:</b> To make sure that the
SP lies in the Atari address space when switching into the Atari MMU
mode, one must previously reserve a stack area for this and then use
that. To ensure that the stack is large enough (1-2 kB are <i>clearly
not enough!</i>) one should heed the cookie value <a href="#minStackSize">minStackSize</a>!
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Always switch to supervisor-mode before '<a href="#modeAtari">modeAtari</a>' is called
(else it won't run under virtual memory). The following code is
suggested for this:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>             clr     d0
             move    sr,d0
             btst    #13,d0
             bne     ok1
             moveq   #8,d0        ;   Enter supervisor-mode
             dc.w    $A08D        ;   _DebugUtil
       ok1:
             move    d0,-(a7)     ;   Save the old mode

             ; Here now <a href="#modeAtari">modeAtari</a> ... Call <a href="#modeMac">modeMac</a> etc.

             move.w  (a7)+,sr     ;   Restore old mode
</pre>
</p></li>
<li><p> Mac subroutines may only alter the registers d0-d2/a0/a1 as a
rule, though not (as often usual on the Atari), a2!
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Clean_20programming">14.1.7 Clean programming</a></h3>
<p>Even if the specific implementation of <a href="#MagiC_20Mac_20specifics">MagiC Mac</a> is not of interest
to every Atari programmer, there are some basic rules that one should
adhere to on the Atari level to be as certain as possible that the
programs can run also under MagiC Mac. Here the following points can
be mentioned, amongst others:
</p>
<a name="Code_2C_20self-modifying"></a>
<a name="Self-modifying_20code"></a>
<a name="CPU_20cache_20purging"></a>
<a name="Cache_20purging_2C_20CPU"></a>
<a name="Purging_20of_20the_20CPU_20cache"></a>
<a name="MC680x0_20cache_20purging"></a>
<ul>
<li><p> <b>Self-modifying code</b>
<br>When code (also applies for XBRA vectors) is altered, it is
imperative that the CPU cache is purged. Although by testing one can
ascertain whether this is not necessary on a 68020 with its small
cache, one can never be certain: On the Mac there is a 68k emulator
for the PowerPC machines that simulates a 68020, which, first, has a
larger cache than a real 68020 (inclusive of a data cache which is
otherwise present only with the 68030), and second also compiles the
code into PowerPC code.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If the code of an Atari program is then changed, the emulator
can only recognize this is a command for cache purging is executed.
Equally, a cache purge is necessay as a rule with the 68040/60 CPUs!
Here is the code with which the whole cache is purged in such cases:
<br>&nbsp;
<table class="UDO_env_xlist">

</table>

<br>The processor type should be obtained for this by inspection of
the <a href="bios_cookiejar.html#Cookie_2C_20_CPU">_CPU</a> cookie.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <b>Blocking interrupts</b>
<br>If the interrupts have to be bloked for a short time, then
<i>never</i> set the SR afterwards to the fixed value $2300, but save
the old SR if possible before the blocking (say onto the stack) and
then load it back again afterwards. If it is imperative that a reset
of the SR is to take place irrerspective of the old SR, then set the
interrupt mask to zero and <i>not</i> to three, so for instance MOVE
#$2000,SR instead of MOVE #$2300,SR. The Atari operating system then
automatically looks after converting the mask value to 3, while the
mask remains on 0 for the Mac; because otherwise nothing works any
more.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <b>Hardware accesses</b>
<br>Before programming certain hardware registers directly (e.g. the
Centronics port for printing), one should check the <a href="bios_cookiejar.html#Cookie_2C_20_MCH">_MCH</a> cookie. If
its value is $FFFFFFFF (dec. -1), then it means that <i>no</i> Atari
hardware is present (so that the program is running on the Macintosh,
for instance) and therefore one shouldn't even try to access the
hardware since there may well be RAM there, which of course may
<i>not</i> be altered by such accesses.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <b>Supervisor-mode</b>
<br>Since multitasking operating systems such as MultiTOS and <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a>
have came into use, no program should arbitrarily change the
supervisor stack pointer, say to obtain a larger stack, as this could
lead to incalculable system crashes (on the PCI Macs, for instance, a
very large supervisor stack is required: at least 8 MB, but in some
circumstances even 24 MB - only the operating system can know this and
install it correctly). <b>Important:</b> To get into the
supervisor-mode, <i>never</i> use the GEMDOS function <a href="gemdos_system.html#Super">Super</a>, but use
<a href="xbios_special.html#Supexec">Supexec</a> from the BIOS instead. Only <a href="xbios_special.html#Supexec">Supexec</a> can ensure that a
sufficiently large supervisor stack will be used.

<a name="Shutdown_20in_20MagiC_20Mac"></a>
<p>Under <a href="#MagiC_20Mac_20specifics">MagiC Mac</a> the shutdown process will be taken on by the
program 'shutdown.prg'; if this was able to terminate all currently
active (Atari) programs, then MagiC Mac itself will be terminated as
well. Some programmers might find it of interest how one can terminate
MagiC Mac <i>without a query.</i> This can be done in two steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Switch to the Macintosh-mode (with <a href="#modeMac">modeMac</a>)
</li>
<li> Execute the Mac routine <i>ExitToShell.</i>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>In Pure-C this could look as follows, for instance:</b>
</p>
<pre>  static pascal void ExitToShell (void) 0xA9F4;
  <a href="emulators_magicmac.html#MgMcCookie">MgMcCookie</a> *mgmc;
  ...
  ...
  get_cookie (&quot;MgMc&quot;, &amp;mgmc); /* Pointer to MgMc cookie structure    */
  mgmc-&gt;<a href="#modeMac">modeMac</a> ();           /* Switch to Mac-mode                  */
  ExitToShell ();             /* Terminates MM at once without query */
</pre>
<p>This information could be important if you want to program your
own shutdown.prg.

<h3><a name="XCMDs_20under_20MagiC_20Mac">14.1.9 XCMDs under MagiC Mac</a></h3>
<p>XCMDs are small external code modules for <i>Macintosh</i>
applications. As a rule these can be created fairly easily with the
development tools under MacOS (e.g. with Metrowerks'
<i>CodeWarrior</i> or Symantec C). As of version 1.2.2 MagiC Mac
also permits the simple use of such code modules by programs that run
under <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a>. This greatly simplifies the development of programs or
drivers that want to use the Macintosh functions, as these portions
can then be created with a Macintosh compiler, rather than having to
recreate the interfaces laboriously under an Atari development system.
</p>
<p>An example of such a XCMD can be found in the <i>'Demo
XCMD'</i> folder of the original MagiC Mac documentation. The created
module can then just be placed in the <i>MagiC Mac XCMDs</i> folder.
This folder must lie in the same directory as the MagiC Mac
application. At the launch of MagiC Mac this folder is searched
through for files with the filetype 'xCmd' and the XCMD resources
contained in it loaded and executed. These XCMDs can then register
themselves with MagiC Mac and so become available for MagiC
programs.
</p>
<p><b>An application is shown by the Pure-C program in the
'MGMC_API' folder of the original MagiC Mac documentation</b>. This
shows how easily an <a href="xbios_sound.html#installed">installed</a> XCMD can be opened and called. The
functions offered here by the cookie (xcmdMgrPtr) go automatically
into the supervisor-mode if required and switch to the Mac environment
(with <a href="#callMacContext">callMacContext</a>), and also control parameter passing. The call of
the XCMD functions in this way is therefore permitted only when the
Atari-mode is active and if the call is not made from an interrupt.
</p>
<p>If the XCMD functions are to be called from interrupts or in
Mac-mode, one can use 'xcmdMgrPtr-&gt;getAdr' to get the entry address
of the XCMD dispatcher and then jump to it directly.
</p>
<p>Further information for XCMDs can be found in the source text
'Demo XCMD.c' of the original MagiC Mac documentation.

<h3><a name="Cooperation_20between_20MagiC_20and_20the_20MacOS">14.1.10 Cooperation between MagiC and the MacOS</a></h3>
<p>MagiC Mac hooks itself directly into all interrupt vectors that
the Macintosh uses. If <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> is running and a hardware interrupt
occurs, MagiC Mac switches the MMU back into the normal
Macintosh-mode. At the end of the IntrRoutine one will be switched
back into the Atari-mode and the programs running under MagiC will
continue. As long as the Mac-mode is active, MagiC Mac does
<i>not</i> meddle further with the Intr-processing, but does so only
when the Atari-mode is active.
</p>
<p>Whenever a switch is made from the Mac-mode back to the
Atari-mode, a check is made whether a given amount of time has passed
(measured in ticks; a tick is around 1/60s), in order to then perform
periodic tasks. These tasks are called Mac-tasks here.
</p>
<p><b>Mac-tasks perform the following, amongst others:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Poll the Mac events (functions GetOSEvent or WaitNextEvent)
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Evaluate [Command]-[Q] and [Command]-[W]
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Evaluate external Apple events, e.g. <a href="powerdos.html#Suspend">Suspend</a>/Resume (switch
MagiC Mac into the background) and terminated externals
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Cede CPU time to other Mac applications (with WaitNextEvent)
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The decision whether to use GetOSEvent or WaitNextEvent (WNE)
for polling the events can be set via 'Preferences' and also by a
cookie function. Only if WNE is used will CPU time be allocated to
other Mac applications as well.
</p>
<p>Mac-tasks can be executed only if it is certain that no other
MacOS function is being processed at the time, since the MacOS is not
reentrant. <b>Mac-tasks are therefore performed only if all of the
following conditions apply:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> After the interruption (an interrupt or a <a href="#modeAtari">modeAtari</a> call) the
Atari-mode will be active and the interrupt-level mask is zero, i.e.
there is <i>no</i> other interrupt being handled (to ensure this,
Intr-handlers that switch from Mac-mode into the Atari-mode have to
use intrLock correctly, see below)
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> No routine in the Mac-context is being executed at the time
(<a href="#callMacContext">callMacContext</a>)
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> MagiC Mac is <i>not</i> in the process of terminating itself

<h4><a name="mmc_flg1_bit4">14.1.11.2 mmc_flg1_bit4</a></h4>
<p>The lower I/O area ($00FF8000-$00FFFFFF) is <i>not</i> present
as such, i.e. quite normal RAM may reside there, just as in any other
place. In that case <i>no</i> distinction will be made between ST-RAM
and TT-RAM - the whole of the RAM used by MagiC Mac, even that above
16 MB, will be made available as <b>ST-RAM</b>.
</p>
<p>This means, of course, that in this case programs can make
<i>no</i> I/O accesses to this area! If this bit is cleared (not
set), a program can make accesses there nevertheless and count on a
bus error if no Atari-compatible hardware (such as <i>McSTout</i>,
say) is <a href="xbios_sound.html#installed">installed</a> there.
</p>
<h4><a name="mmc_flg1_bit5">14.1.11.3 mmc_flg1_bit5</a></h4>
<p>The upper I/O area ($FFFF8000-$FFFFFFFF) is <i>not</i>
accessible as such (see <a href="#MagiC_20Mac_20and_20Power-Macs">MagiC Mac and Power-Macs</a>); on accessing it one
does <i>not</i> get a bus error, but data from the Macintosh-ROM.
</p>
<h4><a name="auxControl">14.1.11.4 auxControl</a></h4>
<p>This is intended for the HSMODEM driver: The WORD parameter on
the stack determines whether the ports are to be released (2 = close
completely, 0 = close, but hold DTR if necessary) or if reassignment
of the ports is permitted (value = 1). Between value-0 and value-1 the
names (auxInPort, auxOutPort) may have changed.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The call should be made in Atari supervisor-mode,
the USP is undefined.

</p>
<h4><a name="callMacContext">14.1.11.5 callMacContext</a></h4>
<p>This serves to produce the required Macintosh environment for
calling any MacOS routines. <b>The routine must be called in Mac-mode
and in supervisor-mode and not from an interrupt.</b>
</p>
<p>For this one should pass on the stack the address of the routine
that is to be called as a subroutine in the Mac context. The normal
user stack of MagiC Mac is used for the called routine; in addition
the register a5 is loaded with macA5 and if virtual memory is active,
a switch is made to user-mode. As this function alters the stack, it
is <i>not</i> possible to pass parameters via the stack. The
registers d0-d2/a0/a1/a5/a7 are altered both at the call and also at
the return of the subroutine (although a5/a7 after return from
'callMacContext' have the same values as before the call). The other
registers are <i>not</i> altered and can be used for parameter
passing and returns.
</p>
<p>The execution of this subroutine implicitly brings calls of
<a href="#intrLock">intrLock</a> and intrUnlock with it, meaning that during this no Mac-tasks
will be processed, even if one switches into Atari-mode occasionally.
To allow processing of Mac-tasks despite of this, one can call the
function '<a href="#giveTimeToMac">giveTimeToMac</a>'.

<h4><a name="configKernel">14.1.11.6 configKernel</a></h4>
<p>This offers access to some settings that are otherwise
accessible only interactively from the Macintosh side. For this one
passes as a rule a function number in the <i>function</i> parameter
and a pointer to a variable in the <i>data</i> parameter, which has
to contain the value to be set before the call, or -1 in case no new
value is to be set.
</p>
<p>After the call the variable contains the current value. The
settings will be adopted in the 'Preferences' if nothing else is
specified. The functions:

</p>
<h4><a name="intrLock">14.1.11.9 intrLock</a></h4>
<p>This must be called before switching to Atari-mode from a
Macintosh routine that could run in an interrupt. In addition, one has
to count on the fact that before the switch a foreign stack is active
which does <i>not</i> belong to the address space of the Atari-mode.
</p>
<p>Therefore one has to switch beforehand to a stack (see
<a href="#minStackSize">minStackSize</a>) from the Atari address space. After switching back to
the Macinntosh- mode one has to call intrUnlock, of course.
</p>
<p>With the aid of these intr-semaphores one can recognize when the
CPU executes commands under MagiC in a non-interrupt state. This
state <i>has</i> to be recognized, because only then can the
Macintosh background processes and other Macintosh routines be called
without risk by the MagiC Mac kernel through its interrupt control
routines. (While the interrupt routines or Macintosh routines are
being processed, no Mac routines may be called by the MagiC Mac
kernel, because the MacOS is not reentrant. During this time no Mac
events are handled; even [Command]-[W]/[Q] do not function at that
time).

<h4><a name="atariModePossible">14.1.11.11 atariModePossible</a></h4>
<p>This points to a byte indicating whether a switch from the Mac
to the Atari MMU-mode is possible at that instant (0=forbidden,
1=allowed). So long as the Macintosh is running without virtual memory
(VM) (also without RAM-doubler), the '<a href="#modeAtari">modeAtari</a>' call is always
possible; however if VM is active and also the 'UnlockMemOnMacSide'
flag is non-zero, then on switching from the MagiC to the Mac screen
the memory occupied by MM (MagiC Mac) for the TPA will be released
for offloading.
</p>
<p>However, as soon as the VM management offloads a block, the MMU
tables calculated by MM are no longer valid and must be calculated
anew prior to the next switch to the Atari-mode. This is not done
automatically, however, but only when switching back to the Atari
screen. For this reason interrupt and other asynchronous routines that
are <a href="xbios_sound.html#installed">installed</a> under MagiC Mac by MacOS functions may <i>not</i>
perform Atari-mode switches under the described circumstances.
</p>
<p>Atari programs that hook into the Atari vectors (e.g. the VBL
vector at $70) need not take all of this into account, since in cases
when the MMU tables become invalid the Atari interrupts will not even
be simulated any more. In cases where one should take further measures
before or after the status of the flags alters one can install also a
routine via <a href="#macAppSwitch">macAppSwitch</a> that then indicates this event with the
values 3 and 4 in d0.W).

<h4><a name="modeAtari">14.1.11.12 modeAtari</a></h4>
<p>Before this function can be called the following conditions have
to be fulfilled:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> The Mac-mode must be active
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> The CPU must be in the supervisor-mode. Under virtual memory,
Mac programs and also the Mac interrupt routines run in user-mode. If
one wants to switch occasionally to the Atari-mode from there, one has
to change to the supervisor-mode beforehand. See
'EnterSupervisorMode'.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> The current stack must lie in Atari address space, else the CPU
freezes immediately due to a double bus error if the program is
running on a 68k computer - because then other areas, including the
stack area, are no longer addressable. Please see also <a href="#minStackSize">minStackSize</a>
for this.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#atariModePossible">atariModePossible</a> must indicate that MMU switching is
permitted. Otherwise, with MacsBug <a href="xbios_sound.html#installed">installed</a>, the following message

<h4><a name="modeMac">14.1.11.13 modeMac</a></h4>
<p>This can be called at any time, also in interrupt routines, as
long as the program is in the Atari-mode and in supervisor-mode at the
time. After the call the whole Mac address space can be accessed.
</p>
<p>The memory that starts in Atari-mode at address zero, starts in
the Mac-mode at the position to which <i>atariZeroPage</i> points. If
a switch was made from a normal Atari application to the Mac-mode with
modeMac, then only those MacOS routines may be called that may also be
called in an interrupt (see 'Inside Macintosh'); if necessary one also
has to place in register a5 the value from macA5. Other routines
should be called only with <a href="#callMacContext">callMacContext</a>, particularly those that use
the QuitDraw routines - if appropriate this has to be tried out. If a
call of callMacContext is required, this can be recognized often by the fact
that bus errors occur otherwise, or no texts appear in dialog boxes
etc.

<h4><a name="versionOfMacAppl">14.1.11.14 versionOfMacAppl</a></h4>
<p>With this one obtains the version identifier of the running
MagiC Mac application (i.e. the ID that can also be displayed in the
Finder). At last programs can adjust themselves to the MM versions!
</p>
<h4><a name="giveTimeToMac">14.1.11.15 giveTimeToMac</a></h4>
<p>This serves for ceding time to Mac event handling of MagiC Mac
if the computer spends too long in Mac-mode (sensible from 1/60s
onwards), e.g. while waiting for completion of asynchronous processes.
</p>
<p><b>'giveTimeToMac' can be called as often as desired</b>; the
Mac events are in any case only polled as frequently as set in the
Preferences (normal: every 1/60s, which is also the maximum
frequency). In order to call the routine, the complete Mac context
must be fashioned, i.e. the applications stack must be active and a5
set accordingly (this is achieved for instance with <a href="#callMacContext">callMacContext</a>).
The routine performs no other actions that do not happen otherwise as
well when the Atari-mode is active and during this the Mac events are
polled automatically in turn. A specialty is that the routine does not
evaluate a pending Quit command, so that the routine that calls
'giveTimeToMac' can assume that it will be its turn again immediately
(as long as a fatal error does not occur).

</p>
<h4><a name="minStackSize">14.1.11.16 minStackSize</a></h4>
<p>This specifies the minimum size for the supervisor stack, in
case a program has to reserve such stack space itself (for example
when a callback routine is called from MacOS and this then wants to
call a routine in Atari-mode, because one has to ensure there that the
SP when switching to the Atari-mode lies within the Atari address
space and this can only be effected with an own, local stack).
</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> It is imperative that one keeps to this value,
because though 5 kb suffice on the older 68k machines as a rule, on
the newer PCI PowerMacs over 12 kb is required when the network
(Ether-Talk) is active! However, it is best if one forgoes the
creation of one's own supervisor stack completely, to avoid such
problems in the future. In case of doubt one should contact the author
of the MagiC Mac kernel!

<h4><a name="ext">14.1.11.17 ext</a></h4>

<br>Converts a Macintosh filepath to a GEMDOS-conform path.
<i>data</i> points to the following structure: First an FSSpec (see
Mac docs), followed by a buffer with room for 256 characters. This
buffer is filled by a C-string that describes a complete pathname,
with which the file can be accessed via GEMDOS file functions. It may
be a good idea later that this path goes via the pseudo-drive 'u:\',
in which all currently present Mac drives are then available. One must
also take into account that we are dealing with file and folder names
that do not fit into the 8+3 scheme.
<br>If we are dealing with a folder, then the path is terminated with
'\' in any case. If a path cannot be obtained, say because none of the
configured MagiC drives 'sees' the relevant folder, the function
returns the value -2. On success, a 0 is returned.

</p>
<h4><a name="extMac">14.1.11.18 extMac</a></h4>
<p>Corresponds to 'ext', though the call must be made in the Mac
context (see '<a href="#callMacContext">callMacContext</a>'). It is advantageous if, due to call of
other Mac functions, the program is already in the Mac-mode. Calls
from interrupts are not permitted as a rule.
</p>
<h4><a name="stackLoad">14.1.11.19 stackLoad</a></h4>
<p><i>stackLoad</i> activates a new CPU stack (a7).
</p>
<p>This is required when one wants to call a routine in the Atari
context from a Mac context during which an arbitrary CPU stack is
active, i.e. before a mode-change with '<a href="#modeAtari">modeAtari</a>' has been performed.
A switch to another stack is necessary then, because the memory area
that a7 is currently using may be blanked out through the switch to
Atari-mode, which could lead to the CPU freezing (see also the
relevant parts of '<a href="#Exceptions_20under_20MagiC_20Mac">Exceptions under MagiC Mac</a>').
</p>
<p>Instead of simply placing the a7 onto the new stack, one should
use 'stackLoad'. Basically this function does the same thing, but it
also informs the MacOS about this (by setting some global variables).
As a result the MacOS does not check a7 periodically in the meantime.
The reason is because otherwise, with certain MacOS versions (prior to
7.5 and again as of 7.5.3), the MacOS would issue a stack overflow
message even though this has not occurred.
</p>
<p>If virtual memory is active, this call also prevents this stack
area being offloaded, which could result in the computer freezing in
some circumstances.
</p>
<p>Usage: In a0 one should pass a pointer to a MemArea structure
(see above). This must contain a pointer to the start (lowest address)
of the stack as well as its length (respect '<a href="#minStackSize">minStackSize</a>'!). The
routine will destroy the registers a0 and a1 and sets a7 to the value
of &lt;MemArea.start+MemArea.length&gt;.
</p>
<h4><a name="stackUnload">14.1.11.20 stackUnload</a></h4>
<p>The inverse of '<a href="#stackLoad">stackLoad</a>'. This is to be called if the stack
that was active previously is to be used again.
</p>
<p>The routine destroys the register a0 (a7 receives again the
value it had before the <a href="#stackLoad">stackLoad</a> call).
