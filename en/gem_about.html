<h1><a name="GEM">2.2 GEM</a></h1>
<p>GEM (<b>G</b>raphics <b>E</b>nvironment <b>M</b>anager) is a
part of the operating system that represents the (graphical) interface
between the computer and the user. GEM was developed by the firm
<i>Digital Research</i> in 1984 for PCs with Intel processors. The
system became well-known, however, mainly when the Atari ST was
marketed, offering a powerful and well- priced alternative to the (at
the time) expensive PC and Macintosh machines.
</p>
<p>In the course of time, GEM was adapted to various operating
systems and hardware platforms, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li> PC GEM
</li>
<li> Atari GEM
</li>
<li> GEM on X (version for Unix systems)
</li>
<li> <a href="gem_about.html#X_2FGEM">X/GEM</a>, for FlexOS operation system
</li>
</ul>

<p>GEM may be divided into two sub-areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="aes_about.html">AES</a>, Application Environment Services
</li>
<li> <a href="About_the_VDI.html">VDI</a>, Virtual Device Interface
</li>
</ul>

<p>The AES takes charge of organising the user environment,
whereas the VDI looks after a uniform graphical rendition of the
user interface. During development of GEM programs it is imperative to
keep to the valid <a href="guidelines_styles.html">style guidelines</a> and never attempt to force on the user one's
own interface 'surface' that doesn't keep to any standards.
</p>
<h3><a name="The_20various_20GEM_20versions">2.2.1 The various GEM versions</a></h3>
<p>For the <a href="#GEM">GEM</a> version number one normally uses the ID returned in
the global field by the <a href="appl.html#appl_init">appl_init</a> call. The <a href="About_the_VDI.html">VDI</a>, on the other hand,
has actually <i>no</i> version number of its own, the more so as the
behaviour of the individual <a href="About_the_VDI.html">VDI</a>-functions is determined principally
by the device drivers used which are, after all, replacable.
</p>
<p><b>One can differentiate roughly between the following
<a href="#GEM">GEM</a>-versions:</b>
</p>
<a name="GEM-Version_201.x"></a>
<p><b><a href="#GEM">GEM</a> 1.x:</b> This first <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> version (1.x) had, not
accidently, very great similarities with the operating system of the
Apple Macintosh. This manifested itself not only in the design of the
window elements, but also in many features of the desktop and other
application programs. At the time, GEM was exhibited mostly in
connection with test versions of <i><a href="#GEM">GEM</a>-Draw, <a href="#GEM">GEM</a>-Paint</i> and
<i><a href="#GEM">GEM</a>-Write</i>, which corresponded in many details with the known
Macintosh prototypes MacDraw, MacPaint and MacWrite.
</p>
<p>This is also the version that was finally adopted by Atari and
delivered in the ST; all newer versions of Atari-GEM are also based
on this version. This is because the Atari company then acquired all
the rights for the existing version, and itself continued to develop
it. This also explains the ever-yawning differences between PC-GEM
and Atari-<a href="#GEM">GEM</a>. The greatest defect of the Atari version was surely the
absence of the Graphics Device Operating Systems (GDOS); this contains
device-independent graphical functions, which were implemented on the
Atari only for the screen, and so had to be post- loaded separately
for printers, plotters, cameras etc. As a result (particularly in the
early days of the Atari), each program used their own drivers and
formats, so that data exchange between applications became almost
impossible.
</p>
<a name="GEM-Version_202.x"></a>
<p><b>GEM 2.x:</b> Due to a legal dispute between Apple and
Digital Research (which mainly concerned the look of application
programs and the desktop), the <i>PC-version</i> of the <a href="#GEM">GEM</a> had to be
altered.
</p>
<p>The settlement, which did not affect Atari's GEM-version,
looked like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Some window elements were altered in such a way that they no
longer looked like the Macintosh windows (above all the title bar)
</li>
<li> The Accessory menu wandered into the opposite (right) corner of
the screen
</li>
<li> The functions <a href="graf.html#graf_growbox">graf_growbox</a> and <a href="graf.html#graf_shrinkbox">graf_shrinkbox</a> were eliminated
</li>
<li> The desktop was reprogrammed completely, and tied down to two
fixed windows. Contrary to customary views, however, this was only a
change in the desktop, and <i>not</i> in the <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a>, which continued to
permit up to eight overlapping windows.
</li>
</ul>

<p>However there were not just restrictions, but also improvements.
The most important example one should mention is that accessories
could install their own menu bar.
</p>
<p>This version received the version number 2.0 and was supplied
from 1987 onwards; only a little later it was ported by the Dutch
software house ABC together with <i>GEM-Draw, <a href="#GEM">GEM</a>-Paint,
<a href="#GEM">GEM</a>-Graph</i> and of course the <i>GEM desktop</i> to the Atari.
However this version never attained much importance, unfortunately,
and is today <i>no longer available.</i>
</p>
<a name="GEM-Version_203.x_2C_20PC-"></a>
<p><b>PC-GEM 3.x:</b> This version contained some minor
improvements. Thus the menu behaviour can be switched from drop-down
to pull-down, for instance.
</p>
<p>From GEM/3 version 3.11 on further <a href="vdi_main.html">VDI</a>-functions exist, which
are concerned with Bezier functions and Postscript printers. The
program ARTLINE makes use of these new functions with its vector
fonts.
</p>
<p>Due to the dominance of MS-Windows this version has practically
vanished from the PC market.
</p>
<p>GEM Desktop 3.13 : The last standard retail version shipped.
Part of the GEM PTK/SDK 3.13 which finally was rewritten to support
ANSI C compilers.
</p>
<a name="GEM_2F4"></a>
<p><b>GEM/4:</b> Only made it to the market as runtime support
for Artline/2, PresTeam/2, Publish it/3 etc. The <a href="vdi_main.html">VDI</a> will use EMS, if
available.
</p>
<p>The GEM/3 desktop will not run properly, and a com shell
provided to launch gem/4 apps from the GEM/3 desktop may crash
after repeated use.
</p>
<a name="GEM_2F5"></a>
<p><b>GEM/5:</b> Only made it to the market as runtime support
for Timeworks Publisher 2.1. It had scalable font support using XMS
memory, and adds 3D look and feel to <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> objects.
</p>
<p>Both GEM/4 and GEM/5 added new <a href="vdi_main.html">VDI</a> and <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> calls but their
bindings are unknown. This proprietary <a href="aes_main.html">AES</a> 4.0 has support for a new
MU_HELP message and some calls take an additional parameter for
context-sensitive help. What these features really do is not known.
</p>
<a name="GEM_2FXM"></a>
<p><b>GEM/XM:</b> Probably the model for DRI's X/GEM for FlexOS
(a 32bit protected mode multitasking system). GEM/XM planned to bring
support for multitasking under DOS but remained unfinished. Latest
release is FreeGEM/XM 3.0beta5-je1.
</p>
<a name="ViewMax"></a>
<a name="ViewMAX"></a>
<p><b>ViewMAX:</b> ViewMAX/1 (DR-DOS 5.0) is a 'crippled' GEM/4
kernel and can only be used as a shell to call GEM Applications.
Although designed for DR DOS, it will run under MS-DOS 3.x and later
(minus passwords). To use it with GEM apps you must have a GEM/3
installation as well as a ViewMAX installation. This version was
written in Lattice C 3.x
</p>
<p>ViewMAX/2 (DR-DOS 6.0) was an improved version of the above, but
with the same kernel limitations as the above. This version was
rewritten in Turbo C2.0 and and allows configuration via *.ini file.
</p>
<p>ViewMAX/3 (DR-DOS 7.0) was never released but beta code is
available.
</p>
<a name="Extended_20GEM"></a>
<a name="GEM_2C_20Extended"></a>
<a name="X_2FGEM"></a>
<p><b>X/GEM:</b> This <a href="#GEM">GEM</a> version was developed by <i>Digital
Research</i> on a multi-user multitasking operating system (FlexOS),
and permits the simultaneous handling of several applications in the
foreground.
</p>
<a name="GEM-Version_201.4_2C_20Atari-"></a>
<p><b>Atari-GEM 1.4:</b> Major changes were made by Atari only
in <a href="#GEM">GEM</a> 1.4 of TOS 1.04; best known feature is the greatly improved
file selector.
</p>
<a name="GEM-Version_203.x_2C_20Atari-"></a>
<p><b>Atari-GEM 3.x:</b> <i>Not yet written.</i>
</p>
<a name="GEM-Version_204.x_2C_20Atari-"></a>
<p><b>Atari-GEM 4.x:</b> <i>Not yet written.</i>
