<h1><a name="General_20remarks_20about_20shutdown">11.14 General remarks about shutdown</a></h1>
<p>Shutdown is to be understood as a mechanism that allows the system
to be run down in a controlled manner. In a multitasking environment
it is actually no longer permissible to simply switch off the computer
after use; a reset with the reset button should be taboo as well.
Rather one must ensure that all programs have been terminated properly
and all files closed correctly before the current to the computer is
turned off. If this is ignored, then data losses may well result.
</p>
<p>For this reason UNIX systems or the Apple Macintosh, for
instance, have a Shutdown mechanism; such a one was also introduced by
Atari in MultiTOS and is also available in <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> (as of Version 3.0).
</p>
<p>Shutdown is activated normally via the menu entry 'File/Shutdown' on
the desktop, with the key combination [[Control]-[Alternate]-[Delete],
or by a resolution change. During the Shutdown, no programs can be
launched.
</p>

</p>
<h3><a name="Shutdown_20in_20MultiTOS">11.14.1 Shutdown in MultiTOS</a></h3>
<p>Under MultiTOS, programs must do the following to support the
Shutdown mechanism:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Call <a href="shel.html#shel_write">shel_write</a> (with <i>sh_wdoex</i>= 9), to inform the
AES that they understand the <a href="evnt.html#AP_TERM">AP_TERM</a> message
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Terminate on receipt of an AP_TERM message, or send <a href="evnt.html#AP_TFAIL">AP_TFAIL</a>
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> MultiTOS sends the AP_TERM message here only to
those processes that explicitly understand AP_TERM. As hardly any
programs exist at present that dismiss a corresponding shel_write, an
implementation such as this in MagiC would not give the desired
result. Hence a different procedure was chosen, in which the AP_TERM
message is sent to <i>all</i> running applications.
</p>
<p>See also: <a href="#Shutdown_20in_20MagiC">Shutdown in MagiC</a> &nbsp; <a href="shel.html#shel_write">shel_write</a> &nbsp; <a href="#Shutdown_20as_20seen_20by_20the_20application">Shutdown at the receiver</a> &nbsp; <a href="#Shutdown_20as_20seen_20by_20the_20initiator">Shutdown at the initiator</a>
</p>
<h3><a name="Shutdown_20in_20MagiC">11.14.2 Shutdown in MagiC</a></h3>
<p>Under <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> the Shutdown works a follows: all running programs
receive an <a href="evnt.html#AP_TERM">AP_TERM</a> message signalling that they should terminate
themselves. If there are still programs in memory after a certain
time, then <a href="magic_programs.html#SHUTDOWN">SHUTDOWN</a> outputs an error-message. In the file <a href="magic_programs.html#SHUTDOWN.INF">SHUTDOWN.INF</a>
one can specify program names (without a suffix such as '.prg' or
'.app') that are uncritical and should not lead to an error-message
from SHUTDOWN.
</p>
<p>In addition to this the following points have to be heeded:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> If [Control]-[Alternate]-[Delete] is to be used to terminate
the system, one must ensure that the screen is not locked, i.e. that a
program is not currently processing a dialog box or alert on the
screen, for instance. Furthermore a suitable shell (such as MAGXDESK,
Thing or Jinnee) must have been loaded, i.e. no program may be loaded
in '<a href="shel.html#Single-mode">single-mode</a>' or in the 'Shell not resident' mode (say with
[Alternate]-double-click).
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> f the screen is locked, then only the writeback-demon will be
terminated, i.e. the cache written back. Only after the screen is
released (i.e. after closing of the dialog or alert box) can the
Shutdown be performed.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Should the system have crashed in such a way that no Shutdown is
possible any more, then [Control]-[Alternate]-[Delete] should be
performed for a second time; a warm start will be carried out without
programs being terminated
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> If '<a href="shel.html#Single-mode">single-mode</a>' is active or the shell is not loaded, then again
only the writeback-demon will be terminated and the cache written
back. For a complete Shutdown the running program has to be terminated
so that the shell is active again. The Shutdown then <i>must</i> be
performed via the 'File/Shutdown' menu entry.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>In MagiC 4, the Shutdown mechanism was revised as follow:</b>
The AES now sends a SHUT_COMPLETED message with msg[3] = 0 (i.e. 'Shutdown
terminated unsuccessfully') and msg[4] = -1 (invalid ap_id) if there
are still programs running in the system that do not understand
<a href="evnt.html#AP_TERM">AP_TERM</a> explicitly. With that, a program that only masters the
MultiTOS specification will break off the Shutdown. <a href="magic_programs.html#SHUTDOWN">SHUTDOWN</a>.PRG, on the
other hand, was adapted to the new specification, and functions as
previously, i.e. gives all programs still running a timeout and then
outputs the names of all reluctant applications.
</p>
<p>In addition, the application #0 is no longer passed arbitrary
data in msg[4,5,6,7] on [Control]-[Alternate]-[Delete], but the
following message:
</p>
<pre>  msg[3]     = -1
  msg[4,6,7] =  0
  msg[5]     = <a href="evnt.html#AP_TERM">AP_TERM</a>
</pre>

</p>
<h3><a name="Shutdown_20as_20seen_20by_20the_20application">11.14.3 Shutdown as seen by the application</a></h3>
<p>First one should point out that the Shutdown mechanism in MultiTOS
differs from that in MagiC: Atari's MultiTOS sends an AP_TERM message
only to those applications that have explicitly informed the AES
with shel_write (opcode 9) that they understand the AP_TERM message; on the
other hand MagiC sends the mssage to all active applications.
</p>
<p>The Shutdown will be seen by the AES as successful only when
all programs explicitly understanding <a href="evnt.html#AP_TERM">AP_TERM</a> have terminated
themselves. If an application should intimate that it cannot terminate
itself, then the Shutdown will be broken off. For these reasons, every
program receiving an AP_TERM message has principally only two options:
</p>
<ul>
<li> It terminates itself immediately
</li>
<li> It makes the following call
<pre>msg[0] = <a href="evnt.html#AP_TFAIL">AP_TFAIL</a>;
msg[1] = err;
<a href="shel.html#shel_write">shel_write</a>(10, 0, 0, (char *) msg, NULL);
</pre>
<br>and so informs the AES that the process was interrupted with
the error-code <i>err.</i> The application that has caused the Shutdown
is told the ap_id and error-code of the interrupting application.
</li>
</ul>

<p>If the application reacts differently on the other hand, i.e.
ignores the AP_TERM message, then the behaviour of the system depends
on whether it was informed that the AP_TERM message is understood.
<b>In plain language:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> If the application <i>explicitly</i> understands AP_TERM then
the system starts from the assumption that the application cannot
accept any messages at the time. The Shutdown is not interrupted, but
lasts until the caller (generally the program <a href="magic_programs.html#SHUTDOWN">SHUTDOWN</a>) terminates the
Shutdown. SHUTDOWN uses a timeout for this of 3 seconds, i.e. if 3 seconds
after the start of the Shutdown programs are still active that
understand AP_TERM, the program will break off the Shutdown process.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> If the application does <i>not</i> explicitly understand
<a href="evnt.html#AP_TERM">AP_TERM</a>, then the system tells the initiator of the Shutdown (generally
<a href="magic_programs.html#SHUTDOWN">SHUTDOWN</a>.PRG) that the Shutdown process has been successful. Only
because the <a href="magic_programs.html#SHUTDOWN">SHUTDOWN</a>.PRG is so indulgent with old programs, it tests
whether any applications are still active, and outputs a message if
so. One can specify in the file <a href="magic_programs.html#SHUTDOWN.INF">SHUTDOWN.INF</a> the programs that should
not lead to an error-message, i.e. that need not be terminated.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> If the Shutdown was started with
[Alternate]-[Control]-[Delete], then at first only the writeback-demon
and the application with the ID 0 receives an AP_TERM message; -1 is
entered as sender for this. Application 0 (generally the desktop) then
terminates itself and then starts the Shutdown program.

<h3><a name="Shutdown_20as_20seen_20by_20the_20initiator">11.14.4 Shutdown as seen by the initiator</a></h3>
<p>Shutdown and resolution change are taken on in MagiC by the
program <a href="magic_programs.html#SHUTDOWN">SHUTDOWN</a>, which is called with the following parameters:
</p>
<p>SHUTDOWN.PRG dev txt
</p>
<p>For this <i>dev</i> = -1 if a Shutdown <i>without</i> a
resolution change is to be performed, else = the device number of the
VDI screen driver. <i>txt</i> is the text height for the AES;
generally this should be 0.
</p>
<p>A Shutdown is started with ret = <a href="shel.html#shel_write">shel_write</a>(4, TRUE, 0, NULL,
NULL). Here a return value of 0 signals that a Shutdown is not possible,
because a Shutdown is already running, for instance. A resolution change
is performed with ret = <a href="shel.html#shel_write">shel_write</a>(5, dev, 0, NULL, NULL); here
<i>dev</i> is the VDI device driver. Alternatively, one can
specify a Falcon resolution mode in <i>xdv</i> with shel_write(5, xdv, 1,
NULL, NULL).
</p>
<p>These calls are all MultiTOS-conform. In addition, as of <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> 3
the following call exists: ret = shel_write(5, dev, 100+txt, NULL, NULL).
With this one can set the text height for the AES. One cannot pass
a Falcon resolution with this mode, so <i>dev</i> is the device
number of the VDI screen driver.
</p>
<p>The device number depends on the system in use and the VDI.
With a 'naked' ST or TT030 (without graphics card) the following
allocations apply:
</p>
<div align="left"><table border="0" class="UDO_env_table">
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">1</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">Default resolution</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">2</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">ST-Low</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">(320*200*16)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">3</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">ST-Medium</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">(640*200*4)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">4</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">ST-High</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">(640*400*2)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">6</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">TT-Medium</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">(640*480*16)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">8</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">TT-High</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">(1280*960*2)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top">9</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">TT-Low</td>
  <td align="left" valign="top">(320*480*256)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>When using a graphics card, or on a Macintosh, the device
numbers are found as usual in the ASSIGN.SYS file in the root
directory of the boot drive.
</p>
<p>After a successful shel_write call the system will be in the Shutdown
mode and no more programs can be launched. On successful completion of
the Shutdown or a resolution change the initiator receives the following
message:
</p>
<table class="UDO_env_xlist">
<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[0] =</td>
<td valign="top"> <a href="evnt.html#SHUT_COMPLETED">SHUT_COMPLETED</a>
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[3] =</td>
<td valign="top"> 1 - Shutdown successful

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>or with a resolution change:
</p>
<table class="UDO_env_xlist">
<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[0] =</td>
<td valign="top"> <a href="evnt.html#RESCH_COMPLETED">RESCH_COMPLETED</a>
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[3] =</td>
<td valign="top"> 1 - Resolution change successful

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Successful as far as the system is concerned means that all
progams that understand <a href="evnt.html#AP_TERM">AP_TERM</a> have terminated themselves. If the
Shutdown should be broken off nevertheless, then this can be done by
using ret = <a href="shel.html#shel_write">shel_write</a>(4, FALSE, 0, NULL, NULL). Otherwises a
resolution change will be performed irrevocably when the initiator has
terminated itself. On the other hand the Shutdown will be broken off
when the initiator terminates.
</p>
<p>If a program has refused a Shutdown with <a href="evnt.html#AP_TFAIL">AP_TFAIL</a>, then the
initiator receives the following message:
</p>
<table class="UDO_env_xlist">
<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[0] =</td>
<td valign="top"> SHUT_COMPLETED
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[3] =</td>
<td valign="top"> 0 - Break off Shutdown
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[4] =</td>
<td valign="top"> ap_id of the application that has refused
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[5] =</td>
<td valign="top"> Error-code of this application

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>bzw. beim Auflösungswechsel
</p>
<table class="UDO_env_xlist">
<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[0] =</td>
<td valign="top"> RESCH_COMPLETED
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[3] =</td>
<td valign="top"> 0 - Resolution change broken off
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[4] =</td>
<td valign="top"> ap_id of the application that has refused
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">msg[5] =</td>
<td valign="top"> Error-code of this application

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In this case the system has already terminated the Shutdown or
resolution change, i.e. the initiator cannot do anything any more.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Because it is possible that the Shutdown process is
never reported by the system as complete or broken off (the
<a href="evnt.html#RESCH_COMPLETED">RESCH_COMPLETED</a> or SHUT_COMPLETED message is never sent), the initiator should
forsee a timeout while waiting for the message. In that case the
Shutdown must be broken off explicitly. With <a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a> the initiator
can test whether there are still programs active that do not
understand AP_TERM explicitly.
