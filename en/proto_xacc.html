<h1><a name="XAcc">15.13 XAcc</a></h1>
<p>The XAcc protocol was originally designed for non-multitasking
versions of GEM to allow data exchange between the main application
and any number of accessories. Since the AES did not provide a
function to find the application IDs (apIDs) of other applications
without knowing their names, XAcc had to rely on the undocumented
feature that the main application always has the apID 0. Therefore
XAcc in its present <a class="UDO_footnote" title="refers to the XAcc definition before &quot;Classic XAcc&quot;">(1)</a> form does not work in a multitasking
environment. However, AES 4.0 provides the new function
<a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a>, which allows any application to find the apIDs of all
other applications running concurrently. This makes it possible to
design a modified XAcc that does not use any 'dirty tricks'. This
document contains a proposal for such a modified XAcc; the changes
with respect to the previous definition are small and modifying an
existing XAcc-based application should be a matter of minutes. Since
single-tasking TOS will still be with us for a while, applications
are encouraged to implement both 'traditional' and 'modern' XAcc,
depending on the version number of the AES.

<h3><a name="Purpose_20of_20XAcc">15.13.1 Purpose of XAcc</a></h3>
<p>The GEM AES functions <a href="appl.html#appl_write">appl_write</a> and <a href="appl.html#appl_read">appl_read</a> can be used
to exchange data between GEM applications running concurrently. In
practice however, some problems need to be solved to make good use of
these two functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> There are no standard messages for exchanging data. Their
definition is the main goal of <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="appl.html#appl_write">appl_write</a> needs the receiver's application identifier (apID).
The only way to get this (before AES 4.0) is to call <a href="appl.html#appl_find">appl_find</a>,
which needs the receiver's name. Thus communication is only possible
if the sender knows the receiver's name.
<br>This problem is solved in AES 4.0 by the introduction of the
function <a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> The main application does not know when an accessory is
activated or deactivated. This would often be useful, for example if
the main application changes system variables that could affect the
accessory's behaviour. If the main application were informed before
the accessory gains control, it could reset those to their old values
and change them back after the accessory is finished.
<br>Another advantage would be that after an accessory has been
called, the main application could check if something has been written
to the clipboard or if other changes to the environment have been
made.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>With multitasking GEM, the situation has changed in several
important ways. The possibility of using several 'main' applications
in parallel makes it even more undesirable to let them directly
manipulate system variables and the like; nevertheless there will
probably always remain some purposes that require such methods. On the
other hand, at least for applications using windows (the preferred
method to get the most out of a multitasking system) it is now
possible to detect changes of the active application by interpreting
the new AES messages <a href="evnt.html#WM_ONTOP">WM_ONTOP</a> and <a href="evnt.html#WM_UNTOPPED">WM_UNTOPPED</a>. Therefore it is not
considered necessary for XAcc to provide additional means to achieve
this.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The communications protocol described in this document solves
all these problems. It was designed for two distinct purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Exchanging data of standard types between programs that have no
information about each other.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> Exchanging data between specific applications known to each
other. The standard protocol ensures that program combinations from
different vendors do not interfere with each other.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A potential problem caused by this protocol should be mentioned
at this point: for single-tasking GEM versions, it relies on the
currently undocumented fact that the main application's apID is always
zero. Without this assumption there is no way to exchange data without
using <a href="appl.html#appl_find">appl_find</a>. Although this fact is not documented, it holds for
all single-tasking versions of GEM in existence until now, both for
MS-DOS and the Atari ST (this information was confirmed by Digital
Research Germany). Of course the main application's apID may be
different in future versions, although there is no reason to change
the current behaviour for single-tasking systems. For AES 4.0 (and
later) the above assumption is not needed anyway, so no compatibility
problems are to be expected in the future.
</p>
<p>A further requirement is that all programs not using this
protocol must ignore its messages. This should not be a serious
problem, as all GEM applications should ignore messages they do not
understand. At the time of writing no programs are known to violate
this rule.
</p>
<h3><a name="Classic_20XAcc">15.13.2 Classic XAcc</a></h3>
<p>The 'classic' <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> protocoll was finally defined on November 28,
1992. All known <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> applications implement the protocol this way.
</p>
<ul class="content">

</ul>
<br>
<h4><a name="XAcc_20message_20groups">15.13.2.1 XAcc message groups</a></h4>
<p>[Note: The 'levels' used in previous XAcc versions have been
replaced by this new concept. Compatibility issues are discussed in a
special section at the end of this document.]
</p>
<p>Both main applications and accessories can have widely different
needs for communication with other programs. Therefore <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> defines
several groups of related messages that deal with a certain range of
data types. The message groups always indicate the messages understood
by a program, not the messages it might send to other ones. If a
program supports a certain message group, it must correctly respond to
all corresponding messages, whether it can actually use the supplied
data or not.
</p>
<p>In addition to XAcc message groups, there are the so-called
'basic messages' which must be supported by any XAcc-aware program,
and program-specific so-called 'special messages'.
</p>
<p>The basic messages deal solely with identification, but no real
data exchange. They are already sufficient for programs that either do
not exchange data with others at all or use only special messages to
communicate with a number of other specific programs.
</p>
<table class="UDO_env_xlist">
<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top"><a href="#Message_20group_201">Message group 1</a></td>
<td valign="top"> specifies the exchange of ASCII-format character data.

<td valign="top"> deals with the exchange of drawings and pictures using the
GEM metafile format and the GEM bit-image file format.
<br>&nbsp;

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Future extensions might include sound or spreadsheet data. In
addition, a message group could be defined to handle command
interchange between applications, e.g. for a 'Drag&amp;Drop' protocol.
</p>
<h4><a name="XAcc_20messages">15.13.2.2 XAcc messages</a></h4>
<p>There are two kinds of XAcc messages: standard messages, which
must be understood by every participating program, and special
messages intended for communications between specific program
combinations. The standard messages have numbers ranging from 0x400 to
0x7ff, special messages start from 0x800. The latter ones may only be
sent after the receiver has been identified and is known to understand
them. The following description is only concerned with standard
messages. In addition to <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> standard messages, the AES messages
normally sent by the <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#The_20screen-manager">screen manager</a> may be used. The most useful ones are
<a href="evnt.html#AC_OPEN">AC_OPEN</a> and <a href="evnt.html#MN_SELECTED">MN_SELECTED</a>; the latter one requires a knowledge of the
receiver and therefore belongs to the special messages.

<p>These messages provide <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> initialization and organization.
This is the only part of XAcc which has to be implemented in a
different way for single- and multi-tasking GEM versions. Note that
the procedure described for 'multitasking' actually only depends on
the existence of <a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a> and hence on an AES version number
&gt;= 4.0. If some future single-tasking AES supports <a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a>,
the 'multitasking' initialization should be used. Multitasking AES
versions with a version number &lt; 4.0 should never exist; to be on
the safe side, applications should not attempt to use XAcc if such a
situation is detected.

<h6><a name="Single-tasking_20GEM_20versions">15.13.2.2.1.1 Single-tasking GEM versions</a></h6>
<p>The communication between the main application and the
accessories is initiated in the following way:
</p>

<ol class="UDO_env_enumerate">
<li><p> When a main application is started (or terminated), all desk
accessories receive an <a href="evnt.html#AC_CLOSE">AC_CLOSE</a> message from the AES <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#The_20screen-manager">screen manager</a>. In
response they must send an identification to the main application
according to the following format:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>     msg[0]:  <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> (0x400)
     msg[1]:  Sender's apID
     msg[2]:  Length of the message - 16, giving 0
     msg[3]:  Program version number and message groups
     msg[4]  and
     msg[5]:  Pointer to sender's name
     msg[6]:  Menu number (menu_id) as returned by <a href="menu.html#menu_register">menu_register</a>
     msg[7]:  Reserved (see <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a>)
</pre>
<br>The low byte of msg[3] contains a bitmap indicating which
message groups are understood by the sender. Bit zero is set for
message group 1, bit one for message group 2, and so on. This is
independent of the message types which the sender might itself send to
others. The sender of a message must ensure that it is understood by
the receiver. The high byte is used to indicate a program version
number using an arbitrary encoding scheme.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The pointer to the sender's name is stored in a
machine-dependent format. The name itself is a character string
following C conventions, i.e. a string of characters terminated by a
zero byte. To avoid name conflicts, long names are preferred to short
abbreviations. The name must be available at the given address at any
time, it may not be removed after initialization. As the version
number is stored in msg[3], it should not occur again in the name.
(Note: See the section '<a href="#Extended_20names">Extended names</a>' for more details on names.)
<br>&nbsp;
<br><a href="aes_fundamentals.html#Accessories">Accessories</a> using more than one menu entry must issue one <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a>
message for each entry used. <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#Accessories">Accessories</a> without a menu entry must use
a number of -1.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Since msg[1] and msg[2] have the same meaning for all message
types, they are no longer mentioned from now on.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> In response to an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message the main application sends an
identification back to the accessory. The format is identical, except
that there is no menu number and thus msg[6] can be used for any other
purpose if neccessary. The same applies to msg[7].
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> In addition to the <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message, the main application informs
all previously registered accessories about the new one by sending
them the message
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>     msg[0]:  <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> (0x403)
     msg[3]:  Program version number and message groups
     msg[4]  and
     msg[5]:  Pointer to accessory's name
     msg[6]:  Accessory's menu number (menu_id)
     msg[7]:  Accessory's apID
</pre>
</p></li>
<li><p> A desk accessory receiving the <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> message from the main
application sends an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message to the thereby registered
accessory, identical to the one previously sent to the main
application.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> When an accessory is activated by receiving an <a href="evnt.html#AC_OPEN">AC_OPEN</a> message,
it sends the following message to the main application:
<br>msg[0]: <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_OPEN">ACC_OPEN</a>
<br>Just before the accessory returns control to another program, it
sends the message
<br>msg[0]: <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_CLOSE">ACC_CLOSE</a>
<br>When receiving <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_OPEN">ACC_OPEN</a>, the main application restores all system
variables it has changed to their original values (if possible and
neccessary). After receiving <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_CLOSE">ACC_CLOSE</a>, it may set them again to any
desired value.
<br>&nbsp;
<br><a href="aes_fundamentals.html#Accessories">Accessories</a> should change system variables only after sending
ACC_OPEN and restore them before ACC_CLOSE.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>There have been some problems with the implementation of
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_OPEN">ACC_OPEN</a> and <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_CLOSE">ACC_CLOSE</a> that should be mentioned. The system was
designed with windowless accessories in mind, i.e. accessories that
only display a dialog box. For these accessories, the above procedure
is well-defined. <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#Accessories">Accessories</a> that use windows however have no way to
find out if they have been activated or deactivated, because they do
not receive a message to indicate this (starting from AES 4.0, this
problem is solved). Therefore such accessories must be careful with
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_OPEN">ACC_OPEN</a> and <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_CLOSE">ACC_CLOSE</a>. The most important thing is to guarantee that
ACC_OPEN and ACC_CLOSE always occur in pairs, and that in between no other
program gains control. How exactly this is implemented depends on the
specific application. Sometimes the best implementation is not to use
ACC_OPEN and ACC_CLOSE at all.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After initialization is completed, all participating programs
know the identity of all other ones, either by receiving an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a>
message or by receiving an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> message. The main application is
always informed about accessory activities. If in addition it proves
neccessary to inform one accessory about the activation of another
one, this can be accomplished by sending special messages (starting
from 0x800).
</p>
<h6><a name="Multitasking_20GEM_20versions">15.13.2.2.1.2 Multitasking GEM versions</a></h6>
<p>The initialization procedure is much simpler in this case. Any
application, i.e. both 'standard' applications and accessories, uses
<a href="appl.html#appl_search">appl_search</a> to detect all currently running AES processes when it
is started. To each application or accessory (i.e. everything but
system processes) it sends an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message:
</p>
<pre>  msg[0]:  <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> (0x400)
  msg[1]:  Sender's apID
  msg[2]:  Length of the message - 16, giving 0
  msg[3]:  Program version number and message groups
  msg[4]  and
  msg[5]:  Pointer to sender's name
  msg[6]:  Menu number (menu_id) as returned by <a href="menu.html#menu_register">menu_register</a>
  msg[7]:  Reserved
</pre>
<p>The low byte of msg[3] contains a bitmap indicating which
message groups are understood by the sender. Bit zero is set for
message group 1, bit one for message group 2, and so on. This is
independent of the message types which the sender might itself send to
others. The sender of a message must ensure that it is understood by
the receiver. The high byte is used to indicate a program version
number using an arbitrary encoding scheme.
</p>
<p>The pointer to the sender's name is stored in a
processor-dependent format. The name itself is a string of characters
terminated by two zero bytes. To avoid name conflicts, long names are
preferred to short abbreviations. The name must be available at the
given address at any time, it may not be removed after initialization.
It must also reside in globally accessible memory. As the version
number is stored in msg[3], it should not occur again in the name.
(Note: see the section '<a href="#Extended_20names">Extended names</a>' for more details on names.)
</p>
<p>Applications using more than one menu entry must issue one
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message for each entry used. <a href="aes_fundamentals.html#Accessories">Accessories</a> without a menu entry
must use a number of -1.
</p>
<p>When receiving an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> message, an application replies by
sending a message of the same format to the original sender, the only
difference being that <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> is used instead of <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a>. Applications
with several menu entries must again send one message for each entry.
</p>
<p>The messages <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_OPEN">ACC_OPEN</a> and <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_CLOSE">ACC_CLOSE</a> are not used in multitasking
systems.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The only difference between <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> and <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> for
multitasking systems is that an application receiving ACC_ID sends
ACC_ACC as a reply, whereas no reply is sent on receiving ACC_ACC. This
prevents applications from sending <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> to each other indefinitely.
Obviously the name <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a> has lost its original meaning and probably
should be changed. But since the symbolic names do not influence the
actual behaviour of any program, this is not really important at all.
</p>
<p>Since in a multitasking environment every participating
application can terminate, some means must be provided to tell other
applications about this. Therefore the message <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_EXIT">ACC_EXIT</a> has been added
to the list of level 0 messages. Before terminating, any application
sends
</p>
<pre>  msg[0]:  <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_EXIT">ACC_EXIT</a> (0x404)
  msg[1]:  Sender's apID
  msg[2]:  Length of the message - 16, giving 0
</pre>
<p>to all applications that have ever registered themselves by
sending <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a> or <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACC">ACC_ACC</a>.
</p>
<h5><a name="Extended_20names">15.13.2.2.2 Extended names</a></h5>
<p>Experience with <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a> has shown that it would often be useful to
have more information about an application than specified with <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ID">ACC_ID</a>
messages. For example it is sometimes useful to check for a special
feature that is not unique to a single program, but to several similar
ones. This was the motivation for the introduction of &quot;Extended
Names&quot;.
</p>
<p>An &quot;extended name&quot; is a character string of the
format:
</p>
<p>'name'\0XDSC\0'string'\0'string'\0...'string'\0\0
</p>
<p>i.e. a &quot;standard&quot; name followed by the string
&quot;XDSC&quot; (for &quot;e<b>X</b>tended
<b>D</b>e<b>SC</b>ription&quot;), followed by a list of strings
containing additional information. The end of the list is marked by an
additional zero byte.
</p>
<p>Each information string indicates by its first byte what kind of
information it contains. Currently the following types are defined:
</p>
<table class="UDO_env_blist">
<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top"><b>'1'</b></td>
<td valign="top"> - application type (human-readable)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The text following this byte (an ASCII-1, 0x31) should roughly
specify the type of application, e.g. &quot;word processor&quot; or
&quot;spreadsheet&quot;. The purpose is for applications to present
this information to the user to let him/her decide where data should
go. This is not the place for advertising hype; a word processor
should call itself &quot;word processor&quot; and not &quot;document
editing and design system&quot;.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It should be clear that the text should be understandable for
end users, especially it should be in the language used for the user
interface.

<br>Other control codes may only be used if the receiver is known to

<br>&nbsp;
<br>The sender must make sure that the memory used to store the text

<br>&nbsp;
<br>The receiver should normally interpret the text as if it were
typed from the keyboard. A word processor would for example insert it
into the currently edited document (this implies using CR as an
end-of-paragraph mark), a command line interpreter would interpret the
text as a command (which implies using CR as an end-of-line mark).

<br>This message should be regarded identical to a keyboard event.
It can be used to send control commands to a receiver which might have
been issued from the keyboard. Of course this requires a knowledge of
the receiver, as no standard keyboard command sets exist. It should be
noted that the receiver is free to use only the ASCII-code or only the
scancode, or both of them.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>This message is acknowledged after its interpretation with:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>     msg[0]:  ACC_ACK (0x500)

<h4><a name="Compatibility_20considerations">15.13.2.3 Compatibility considerations</a></h4>
<p>There are two major changes with respect to the original <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a>
definition:
</p>

<ol class="UDO_env_enumerate">
<li><p> &quot;Levels&quot; have been replaced by &quot;message
groups&quot;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The motivation for this change was that the classification
according to exchangeable data types was not really a hierarchical
one; there is no reason why a programm accepting graphics should also
be able to understand text. The new scheme makes no such arbitrary
assumptions.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>There is only one situation in which a possible incompatibility
could occur: an application following the &quot;old&quot; convention
encounters a &quot;new&quot; application and one of them indicates 2
in the level/message group byte. This would be interprets as
&quot;graphics only&quot; by one and as &quot;graphics and text&quot;
by the other. Since the number of level-2 applications was always
extremely small (in fact, the author knows only of a single one), this
should be no problem in practice.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#Extended_20names">Extended names</a> have been introduced
<br>&nbsp;
<br>This could lead to a problem in the extremely unlikely case of
an &quot;old&quot; application using a name string which is
accidentally followed by &quot;XDSC&quot;.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In any case it is expected that most applications will be
converted to the new rules soon, if only to support MultiTOS.

<h3><a name="Extended_20XAcc">15.13.3 Extended XAcc</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes developments of the XAcc protocol after
&quot;<a href="#Classic_20XAcc">Classic XAcc</a>&quot; (11/28/92). Last changes have been made on
June 15, 1995.
</p>
<p>Since the last official documentation for the XAcc protocol,
some extensions have appeared, which are now summarized here. Some of
these extensions have arisen from the special forms of data
interchange between the text processor <i>That's Write</i> and the
address manager <i>That's Address</i> or its successor
<i>no|Address.</i> However, these extensions are also accessible for
any other applications, and the use of these application names in the
following documentation is only for purposes of serving as examples
(<i>That's Address</i> = TA and <i>That's Write</i>= TW). The
extensions comprise:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> <a href="#MailMerge_20protocol">MailMerge protocol</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The actual mail merge output of TW is serviced via this
protocol.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#Remote-Mailmerge_20protocol">Remote-Mailmerge protocol</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Permits an application itself to initiate a mail merge output in
TW.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#Inquiry_20protocol">Inquiry protocol</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Serves for obtaining information about the makeup of a database.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#Request_2FReply_20protocol">Request/Reply protocol</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Serves for general data interchange between applications.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<ul class="content">
	<li>15.13.3.1 <a href="#MailMerge_20protocol">MailMerge protocol</a>
	<li>15.13.3.2 <a href="#Remote-Mailmerge_20protocol">Remote-Mailmerge protocol</a>

	<li>15.13.3.4 <a href="#Request_2FReply_20protocol">Request/Reply protocol</a>
		</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4><a name="MailMerge_20protocol">15.13.3.1 MailMerge protocol</a></h4>
<p>This protocol works with <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_TEXT">ACC_TEXT</a> messages for historical
reasons. The TW sends to TA first an ACC_TEXT message with a string that
starts with '#I' and contains after the 'I' the SDF format string
which tells the TA which parts of an address data-set are to be
transferred.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> '#IA1,A2,A3,A4,T1' (the first 4 address fields
and the first lelephone number).
</p>
<p>After successful receipt of this message, an ACC_TEXT message with
the string '0' is returned to TW, else an empty string ''.
</p>
<p>Now TW can start to request individual address data with the
ACC_TEXT message '#N'. at the receipt of such a message, TA sends for
each address field of an address an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_TEXT">ACC_TEXT</a> message and at the end of
the data set an empty string ''.
</p>
<h4><a name="Remote-Mailmerge_20protocol">15.13.3.2 Remote-Mailmerge protocol</a></h4>
<p>For this protocol there are two new XAcc message types,
namely:
</p>
<a name="ACC_FORCESDF"></a>
<a name="ACC_GETSDF"></a>
<pre>#define ACC_FORCESDF        0x520
#define ACC_GETSDF          0x521
</pre>
<p>TA sends to TW an ACC_FORCESDF when an address or an
address-list is to be sent to TW. If it is dealing only with an
address, msg[4]+[5] contains a pointer to the keyword of the address;
for an address-list msg[4]+[5] contains a pointer to '#L'. The
ACC_FORCESDF message must be conirmed with an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACK">ACC_ACK</a> (msg[3]==1 -&gt;
OK and msg[3]==0 -&gt; <a href="bios_errors.html#ERROR">ERROR</a>).
</p>
<p>When TW receves a '#L', then TW runs a normal MailMerge
protocol. If TW receives a keyword (max. 20 characters long), then TW
requests this address from TA with ACC_GETSDF. The ACC_GETSDF message
must have a pointer in msg[4]+[5] to a buffer that first contains the
keyword with a terminating '\0' followed by the XDF format string
(e.g.: 'JÖRG\0A1,A2,A3\0').
</p>
<p>If TA can understand the ACC_GETSDF message, then it sends an
<a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACK">ACC_ACK</a> with msg[3]==1, else an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACK">ACC_ACK</a> with msg[3]==0. Subsequently
TW will receive the data of this single address as with the normal
<a href="#MailMerge_20protocol">MailMerge protocol</a>.
</p>
<p>TW must have in its XDSC string an 'XRM', so that TA itself will
start a Remote-Mailmerge protocol.
</p>
<p>TA now has the following XDSC features (e.g. ACC):
</p>
<pre>const char ta2Ident[] = &quot;That's Address ACC\0XDSC\0&quot;
                        &quot;1Adressverwaltung\0&quot;
                        &quot;2DB\0&quot;
                        &quot;XMM\0XSU\0XDI\0XRM\0NnoAddress ACC\0&quot;;

<p>Applications that support the protocol elements described above
have to contain the <a href="proto_xacc.html#Extended_20feature">Extended feature</a> 'RQ' in their XDSC description.
</p>
<h3><a name="Example:_20no_7CLink_27s_20XAcc_20protocol">15.13.4 Example: no|Link's XAcc protocol</a></h3>
<p>The <i>no|Link</i> accessory was conceived for the control of
infra-red devices and contains an XAcc communication layer for the
control by special applications. At present the <i>Media-Link</i>
interface of Catch Computer is supported. A further adaptation for the
<i>no|Remote</i> interface of no|Software is in preparation (at the
time this was written).
</p>
<p>The <i>no|Link</i> accessory administers all information
required for the control of the infra-red or other hardware. Each
hardware-dependent code (e.g. an infra-red signal) is assigned a
command, and for each device (e.g. a video recorder) there exists a
list of such commands.
</p>
<p>For example, if an application for the remote control of a video
recorder wants to send an infra-red signal for the 'Play' key, then it
sends <i>no|Link</i> an XAcc message, in which the command 'send',
the device &lt;VIDEORECORDER&gt; and the command &lt;PLAY&gt; are
coded.
</p>
<p>So that an application can communicate completely with
<i>no|Link</i>, it must support the <a href="#Request_2FReply_20protocol">Request/Reply protocol</a>, which is
made known by an <a href="proto_xacc.html#Extended_20feature">Extended feature</a> 'RQ' in the XDSC description. Only
in this way is it possible to maintain the list of the <i>no|Link</i>
registered devices.
</p>
<p>If the application also wants to receive codes from the
accessory (only possible with suitable hardware), then the XDSC
description must contain additionally an <a href="proto_xacc.html#Extended_20feature">Extended feature</a> 'RR' (Remote
Receive). All applications that want to work with <i>no|Link</i> have
to support the XAcc Level/<a href="#Message_20group_201">Message group 1</a>.
</p>
<p>As application type the <i>no|Link</i> accessory receives in
XDSC '\2RC' (Remote Control).
</p>
<p>The complete XAcc identification of <i>no|Link</i> at present
is as follows (in C-syntax, using the original German):
</p>
<pre>    char xaccNoLinkIdent[] =    &quot;Infrarot Manager\0&quot;
                                &quot;XDSC\0&quot;
                                &quot;1Fernsteuerschnittstelle\0&quot;
                                &quot;2RC\0&quot;
                                &quot;XRQ\0&quot;
                                &quot;NnoRci\0&quot;;
</pre>
<p>A possible XAcc identification for a <i>no|Link</i>
application could look like this:
</p>
<pre>    char xaccIdentstring[] =    &quot;VideoControl\0&quot;
                                &quot;XDSC\0&quot;
                                &quot;1Video Fernbedienung\0&quot;
                                &quot;XRQ\0&quot;
                                &quot;Nno|Video ACC\0&quot;;
</pre>
<p>The communication between the application and the
<i>no|Link</i> accessory is mainly via ACC_TEXT messages.
</p>
<p>The accessory at present understands the following commands,
which have to be sent as a string by means of an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_TEXT">ACC_TEXT</a> message
(where &lt;X&gt; := &lt;device&gt;:&lt;command&gt;):
</p>
<table class="UDO_env_blist">
<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top"><b>&quot;S &lt;X&gt;&quot;</b></td>
<td valign="top"> Sending of a command, e.g: 'S VIDEO:PLAY'.

</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top"><b>&quot;P &lt;X&gt;&quot;</b></td>

<td valign="top"> Test of the existence of a command
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Particularly at a new installation of a remote control
application, all devices and commands that this application uses
should be communicated to the accessory!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If <i>no|Link</i> does not know the supplied command, the user
is invited to activate the required 'learning procedure', or to assign
the new command to one already present.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Each remote control application should contain a function that
allows the user to 'test' all supported commands - preferably via an
'<a href="c_task_royal.html#Install">Install</a>' button.
<br>&nbsp;

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The test function is the only one that may lead to interaction
with the user in some circumstances. All others issue no output.
</p>
<p>As reply the application receives an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACK">ACC_ACK</a> message, in which
the success or otherwise of handling the command is noted in msg[3]:
</p>
<table class="UDO_env_blist">

<br>&nbsp;

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top"><b>0</b></td>
<td valign="top"> Device/command is not present, or error in the handling
<br>&nbsp;

</td></tr>

<p>Device and command names may be up to 32 characters long and may
<i>not</i> contain a ':'. No regard is paid to case, i.e. capitals
and lower case characters are not differentiated.
</p>
<p>An application can request a list of registered devices from the
accessory. For this the application has to understand the new <a href="#XAcc">XAcc</a>
<a href="#Request_2FReply_20protocol">Request/Reply protocol</a> (see above, or <a href="#XACC.H">XACC.H</a>).
</p>
<p>To request the list, the application sends a ACC_REQUEST to the
accessory, where the message must be constructed as follows:
</p>
<pre>    msg[0] = <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_REQUEST">ACC_REQUEST</a> (0x480)
    msg[1] = apid
    msg[2] = 0
    msg[3] = 0x04       /* Data-type: Code */
    msg[4] = 'D'        /* 'D' represents 'devices' */
    msg[5] = 0
    msg[6] = 0
    msg[7] = 0
</pre>
<p>As reply the application receives an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACK">ACC_ACK</a> message with msg[3]
== 0 if an error has occured, or on success an ACC_REPLY message:
</p>
<pre>    msg[0] = <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_REPLY">ACC_REPLY</a> (0x481)
    msg[1] = apID of no|Link
    msg[2] = 0
    msg[3] = 0x02       /* Data-type: Environment string */
    msg[4]+msg[5] = Pointer to globally accessible memory containing the
                    list of the devices in the following format:
                           &quot;DEVICEINFOS:\0device1\0device2\0&quot;
    msg[6]+msg[7] = LONG value, specifying the size of the buffer
                    (inclusive of the terminating two NULL-bytes)

</pre>
<p>The receipt of an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_REPLY">ACC_REPLY</a> message must be confirmed
subsequently with an <a href="proto_xacc.html#ACC_ACK">ACC_ACK</a> message, so that the <i>no|Link</i>
accessory can release its resources again!
