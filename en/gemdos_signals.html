<h1><a name="Signals">5.7 Signals</a></h1>
<p>The &quot;signal&quot; concept, originating from the U*NIX
world, is also available in the operating systems MultiTOS (actually
the underlying MiNT) and <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a> (as of Version 4.50). Signals can be
thought of as natural number messages that represent a given exception
condition. They are comparable to an interrupt or a CPU exception, but
with the difference that they deal with a pure <i>software</i>
implementation.
</p>
<p><b>Each process possesses:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> A bit-vector of the pending signal. This describes those
signals that are still waiting to be processed, perhaps because they
are currently blocked by the signal mask, or because the process is in
a state where it cannot process signals.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> A signal mask. This 32-bit value defines those signals that are
currently blocked as a bit-vector; if, say, bit 30 is set in this
vector, then the signal SIGUSR2 is blocked. The signal mask is not
just impacted explicitly (i.e. by system calls) but also
<i>implicitly</i> by other processes. During the processing of a
signal, for instance, it is blocked, yet others may occur. After the
signal has been processed it is released again and any signals waiting
can then be processed. One should note that some signals (e.g.
SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, SIGCONT) can <i>not</i> be masked.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
<li><p> A table in the form <a href="gemdos_structures.html#struct_20sigaction">struct sigaction</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>At a <a href="gemdos_process.html#Pexec">Pexec</a> the signal mask and the pending value (see above) of
the child process will be zeroed. The element <i>sa_handler</i> of
the <a href="gemdos_structures.html#sigaction">sigaction</a> structure is inherited, during which a non-0 or 1 value
is always set to 0. The elements <i>sa_mask</i> and <i>sa_flags</i>
of the structure are zeroed.
</p>
<p>Most signals can be caught by a program (perhaps to call up a
given routine on receipt), ignored, or also blocked. Blocked signals
will be ignored until the blockade is lifted again. <b>Re
terminology:</b> One says that a signal is <i>sent</i> to a process
when the exception that is represented by the signal occurs, or the
signal is sent by another process via <a href="gemdos_process.html#Pkill">Pkill</a>. On the other hand a
signal is <i>caught</i> by a process when the corresponding process
awakes and starts the actions matching the signal. One should note
that the signal handling takes up time: Between sending a signal and
the execution of the matching action a considerable period of time may
pass.
</p>
<a name="Signals_2C_20List_20of"></a>
<p>In total there are 31 possible signals (0 to 30) available, not
all of which however have been assigned a fixed meaning. The following
list describes (as far as known) all possible signals in the form:
Signal number, Name of the signal, Meaning of the signal for the
receiving process. <b>Unless explicitly noted otherwise, the default
action on the receipt of a signal is the killing (termination) of the
receiving process</b>.

MagiC it causes all threads of a process to be paused. When paused,
no mouse or keyboard clicks are lost in MagiC; on a restart of the

previously suspended with SIGSTOP or <a href="gemdos_process.html#Pause">Pause</a>. Though the signal cannot
be masked or ignored, one can install a handling routine for this
signal. In MagiC all threads will be awakened that were paused with a

<td valign="top"> Child terminated: The default action is to ignore the signal.
It is sent to the parent process both on termination as well as
pausing of a child process. In MiNT one can arrange that this signal
is sent only on termination, and in addition one can determine which
child process was affected. As MagiC until now only knows the waiting
<a href="gemdos_process.html#Pexec">Pexec</a> (i.e. the parent waits until the child terminates), this signal
does not exist there. Processes that are created with <a href="shel.html#shel_write">shel_write</a> are
<i>not</i> real child processes, but fully independent ones; in such
cases one therefore has to wait for the arrival of a <a href="evnt.html#CH_EXIT">CH_EXIT</a> message.

<td valign="top"> Window changed: The default action is to ignore the signal.
Normally it is sent if the size of the terminal (i.e. number of lines
or columns) has altered. A program that is running in a terminal
window can then reconfigure itself to match the new size of the
window. For obtaining the current window size one can use in MiNT

<h3><a name="Signal-handler_20in_20MagiC">5.7.1 Signal-handler in MagiC</a></h3>
<p>As <a href="magic.html">MagiC</a>'s signal-handlers differ somewhat from those in MiNT or
in MultiTOS, we will deal here with the most important differences and
features. First of all it must be realised that in MagiC, <a href="aes_about.html">AES</a> and
<a href="About_the_VDI.html">VDI</a> calls from within a signal-handler are <i>permitted</i> (quite
in contrast to MiNT).
</p>
<p>A signal-handler runs in user-mode and employs the user stack of
the main thread, while this sleeps. In MiNT the supervisor stack of
the process is used. Hence, according to the MiNT documentation, the
nesting of signals more than 4 deep makes a process crash due to stack
overflow. In MagiC each signal-handler is its <i>own</i> thread with
its <i>own</i> supervisor stack, so that the worst that can happen is
the extremely rare case of user stack overflow. However, if too little
memory is available for a new thread when handling a signal, then an
&quot;<a href="magic_errors.html#Out_20of_20internal_20memory">Out of internal memory</a>&quot; alert will appear, and one should
terminate a program as soon as possible. MagiC requires about 7 kb of
memory for handling each signal.
</p>
<p>In MagiC, the same applies for signals as for threads (a
signal-handler is a thread), i.e. the corresponding system libraries
have to be <i>reentrant.</i> However, there is a complication because
the main thread is halted while processing the signal. So if the main
thread has set a signal (<a href="wind.html#wind_update">wind_update</a> for example), a deadlock occurs
if the signal-handler also wants to set these signals. Furthermore, in
MagiC a process may be interrupted at almost any point (MagiC is
reentrant, even DOS is interruptible), so that the main thread may in
some cases block important areas of the system (files, directories,
semaphores). Due to this it is possible that certain files cannot be
deleted or opened, for instance.
</p>
<p>With normal termination of a signal-handler all semaphores
blocked by the handler are released automatically. Furthermore,
windows, screen background and menu bar of the signal-handler will be
released if appropriate. Note that a signal-handler has its own AES
message-queue, i.e. evnt_message and <a href="appl.html#appl_write">appl_write</a> should be used with
care.
</p>
<p>On <a href="gemdos_process.html#Psigreturn">Psigreturn</a> the semaphores of all signal-handlers as well as
those of the main thread will be released. However the windows, screen
background and menu bar of the signal-handler will not be released.
Though this would not have been much of a problem, it may not be
necessary in practice. <a href="gemdos_process.html#Psigreturn">Psigreturn</a> restores the supervisor stack of the
main thread, i.e. a setjmp/longjmp mechanism only needs to set the
USP. This is not sufficiently documented in the MiNT documentation,
and also works only if the main thread is waiting via a GEMDOS call.
If AES comes into play, MultiTOS crashes! Hence <a href="gemdos_process.html#Psigreturn">Psigreturn</a> should
be avoided if possible. <a href="gemdos_process.html#Psigreturn">Psigreturn</a> in MagiC is not of the type VOID
as in MiNT, but of the type LONG. If the function is called from a
non-signal-handler, <a href="gemdos_process.html#Psigreturn">Psigreturn</a> returns the value <a href="gemdos_errors.html#EACCDN">EACCDN</a>, otherwise
<a href="gemdos_errors.html#E_OK">E_OK</a>. If <a href="gemdos_process.html#Psigreturn">Psigreturn</a> has returned <a href="gemdos_errors.html#E_OK">E_OK</a>, then (as in MiNT) under <i>no
circumstances</i> should the handling procedure be terminated in the
normal way via rts, because the jump-back address on the user stack is
invalid after execution of <a href="gemdos_process.html#Psigreturn">Psigreturn</a>.
</p>
<p>A problem exists in MagiC with the existing versions of VT52. A
signal-handler <i>cannot</i> yet perform keyboard scans in VT52; the
keys will not be received. This may alter in a later version, however.
</p>

</p>
<h3><a name="Sample_20code_20for_20signals">5.7.2 Sample code for signals</a></h3>
<p>The first program installs a signal-handler for the two signals
<a href="gemdos_signals.html#SIGUSR1">SIGUSR1</a> and <a href="gemdos_signals.html#SIGUSR2">SIGUSR2</a>. With that one can test the nesting of both
signals, if both are sent consecutively. The program should run in VT52
or in MINIWIN. If one presses Ctrl-Alt-Esc during the
&quot;for()&quot; delay loop, one can see that MagiC creates its own
thread for each signal-handler. This has the advantage that under
MagiC no events (mouse, timer, ...) will be lost while a signal is
being processed.

<p>The second program shows the treatment of the <a href="gemdos_process.html#Psigreturn">Psigreturn</a> call.
Under MiNT this program only works if one doesn't use any AES calls
(<a href="evnt.html#evnt_keybd">evnt_keybd</a> or <a href="evnt.html#evnt_multi">evnt_multi</a>), but uses, say, <a href="gemdos_chrinout.html#Cconin">Cconin</a>. This means that the
following program works under MagiC but crashes under MultiTOS (MiNT
1.08+AES 4.1). The problem lies probably in the restoration of the
supervisor stack (system stack pointer), where MultiTOS fails due to
the non-homogenous concept AES&lt;-&gt;MiNT.
