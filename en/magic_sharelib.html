<li> <a href="#How_20do_20I_20write_20a_20library_3F">How do I write a library?</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Shared libraries were introduced already with
MagiC Version 5.20. Due to a design error, they had to change the
format of the library as of Version 6.00. As different
&quot;magic&quot; IDs are used this can not cause crashes; it's just
that the libraries for 6.00 will not be recognized by the old version
5.20, and vice versa. Due to several inadequacies in version 5.20 one
should in any case only create libraries for 6.00.
</p>
<h3><a name="What_20are_20shared_20libraries_3F">11.23.1 What are shared libraries?</a></h3>
<p>Usually libraries with frequently used procedures are collected
in their own object module and then linked with several programs
during compilation. In that case each program receives a copy of the
library, which is integrated firmly into the PRG file. On the other
hand, shared libraries exist as separate files only once on the hard
disk and can be used by several programs, even simultaneously.
</p>
<h3><a name="Why_20shared_20libraries_3F">11.23.2 Why shared libraries?</a></h3>
<p>Compared to hard-linked libraries, using shared libraries
results in a series of advantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Saving of storage space on the hard disk. The more programs
that use the same libraries, the greater the saving.
</li>
<li> Saving of storage space in main memory (RAM). This only comes
into play when several programs that use the same library are loaded
simultaneously.
</li>
<li> Systematic maintenance by the programmer: For an update it may
suffice at times just to distribute a new library. All programs that
use the library will then profit from the update. Additionally there
will be fewer source texts to maintain. When a library has been
altered there is no need to newly translate all of the programs using
it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally there are also disadvantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Program loading takes somewhat longer; however this is so only
if the library has not been loaded yet.
</li>
<li> There may be interaction between updates of various programs.
When exchanging a library, several programs may be affected
(positively or negatively).
</li>
<li> During installation of a program the files have to be copied to
the XTENSION folder (normally in GEMSYS\MAGIC\ of the boot drive) or
to the first folder specified in the searchlist SLBPATH (from MagiC
6), so it is no longer possible to establish easily which shared
library belongs to which program. Remedies, for instance:
<ul>
<li> Only place aliases in the XTENSION folder or the first folder
specified by the environmental variable SLBPATH (see below)
</li>
<li> Leave the shared libraries in a subdirectory of the program and
merely extend the environmental variable SLBPATH in MAGX.INF by this
directory (possible from MagiC 6 onwards). If no SLBPATH variable
exists as yet then one has to enter the XTENSION path in it first.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="How_20do_20I_20use_20a_20library_3F">11.23.3 How do I use a library?</a></h3>
<p>To start with, one needs the object module <a href="#SLB_BIND">SLB_BIND</a> for calling
the two new DOS functions, for which one has to link the file <a href="#SLB.H">SLB.H</a>.
</p>
<p>For each library used one declares a descriptor of the type
SHARED_LIB and a function pointer of the type SLB_EXEC.
</p>
<p>Each library is opened with <a href="gemdos_system.html#Slbopen">Slbopen</a> (opening and closing should
only take place in user-mode), during which the following parameters
are passed:
</p>
<table class="UDO_env_xlist">
<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">char *name</td>
<td valign="top"> The name of the library, in capitals, including the extension
(&quot;.SLB&quot;). The library name is also the filename.
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">char *path</td>
<td valign="top"> If this parameter is not NULL, then first of all a search will
be made for the library (the path must end with '\' in MagiC 5.20;
this is no longer necessary in MagiC 6). The path should be an
absolute one, so that the shared library knows where it lies. If the
parameter is NULL or the library was not found in the specified path,
then a search is made in the XTENSION folder.
<br>From MagiC 6 onwards the environmental variable SLBPATH will be
evaluated. Like PATH it contains a list of search-paths, each
separated by ';'. If the variable is defined no additional search will
be made in the XTENSION folder.
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">LONG min_ver</td>
<td valign="top"> Minimum required version number of the library.
<br>If a program needs, say, version 3 but the library present is only
version 2, then <a href="gemdos_errors.html#ERANGE">ERANGE</a> will be returned. The return value will be the
actual version number of the library.
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">SHARED_LIB *sl</td>
<td valign="top"> Pointer to the descriptor. When the library is opened the
descriptor will be entered here.
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">SLB_EXEC *fn</td>
<td valign="top"> Pointer to the function pointer. When the library is opened the
function pointer will be entered here.

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Return values can be:
</p>
<pre>  &gt;= 0        All OK, version number of the library
  <a href="gemdos_errors.html#ERANGE">ERANGE</a>      Version number too low
  <a href="gemdos_errors.html#EACCDN">EACCDN</a>      Library already opened by this process
  <a href="gemdos_errors.html#EFILNF">EFILNF</a>      Library not found
  <a href="gemdos_errors.html#ENSMEM">ENSMEM</a>      Insufficient memory free
  ...         Other error-codes.
</pre>
<p>The library can now be used and finally closed again with
<a href="gemdos_system.html#Slbclose">Slbclose</a>. This is not absolutely necessary as all open libraries are
closed automatically at program termination, but it is good
programming practice. On no account may a library be closed more than
once, since the kernel can not recognize such errors.
</p>
<p>Some libraries such as EDITOBJC.SLB, for instance, install new
system calls, in this case the AES calls 210..217. For these
libraries the function pointer is not needed. Otherwise all functions
of the library are called via the function pointer. The library call
function is declared in the following way:
</p>
<pre> typedef LONG cdecl (*SLB_EXEC)( SHARED_LIB sl, LONG fn,
        WORD nargs, ... );
</pre>
<p>As regretably Pure-C has an error here, I was forced to declare
this functions as 'typedef LONG (*SLB_EXEC)( void , ... );'.
Unfortunately this inhibits all type checking. So take care!
</p>
<p>The call expects the following <b>parameters:</b>
</p>
<pre>     The descriptor of the library
     A longword (!) for the function number
     A WORD, that specifies the number of arguments in WORDs
             (i.e. all &quot;...&quot; arguments)
     Further arguments, depending on the function.
</pre>
<p>The best way is to make the call via a macro, which should be
defined in a header file for the library, e.g.:
</p>
<p>JPEG.H:
</p>
<p>#define SLBJPEG_WANDELN (a,b) (*slbjpeg_exec)(slbjpeg, 7L, 4, a,
b)
</p>
<p>With this <i>slbjpeg_exec</i> and <i>slbjpeg</i> will be
ascertained at <a href="gemdos_system.html#Slbopen">Slbopen</a>, 7L is the function number for the call WANDELN
(convert), 4 describes the length of the following arguments
(&lt;a&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are two pointers =&gt; 2*4 bytes =&gt; 4
WORDs), and <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the arguments of the function
WANDELN.
</p>
<p>If the function is not present (the library contains a
NULL-pointer for this function, or the function number is higher than
the number of functions actually present), one will receive <a href="gemdos_errors.html#EINVFN">EINVFN</a> as
the function result (in fact this only works correctly from MagiC 6
onwards).
</p>
<h3><a name="How_20do_20I_20write_20a_20library_3F">11.23.4 How do I write a library?</a></h3>
<p>For this too there is a sample library SLB_DEMO, which contains
all the required elements and descriptions. The best thing is to copy
<a href="#SLB_DEMO.C">SLB_DEMO.C</a>, <a href="#LIBHEAD.S">LIBHEAD.S</a> and <a href="#SLB_DEMO.PRJ">SLB_DEMO.PRJ</a> and then modify the files to
suit your requirements. It is most important to ensure that bit 3 of
the flag in the program header of a library is set; one can use
<a href="#PH_BIT3.TTP">PH_BIT3.TTP</a> for this.
</p>
<p>LIBHEAD is the header for a shared library. The pointer to the
function names can be omitted, otherwise it points to a table of
pointers with the names of the library functions. The number of
functions must be stated correctly, as must the table of functions and
the library name, which is identical to the filename. When adding a
function one has to ensure that the function number is adapted
accordingly, and perhaps that the version number is increased.
</p>
<p>For publicly available shared libraries one has to ensure that
documented function calls are never altered! They can either be
supplemented with new parameters (the called function can inquire the
number of parameters actually passed), or a new function number should
be used.
</p>
<p>NULL-pointers are also permissible for the function pointers;
they return a <a href="gemdos_errors.html#EINVFN">EINVFN</a> when the function is called.
</p>
<p>The following functions for (de-)initialization are obligatory:
</p>
<p><u>slb_init/slb_exit</u>
</p>
<p>These are called during loading and removal of the library
respectively, and at that in supervisor-mode and in the context
(process) of the library. Typically, slb_init loads a configuration
file, allocates global memory for the library and opens a virtual
VDI workstation. slb_exit writes back the configuration file,
releases the memory again and closes the VDI workstation.
</p>
<p>If slb_init opens a file, then the handle can only be accessed
again at slb_exit, as all other calls of the library run in the
context of the calling application.
</p>
<p>From MagiC 6 onwards the library is passed a normal 'C'
character string in the command line structure which contains the
complete path of the shared library. If the shared library has to load
configuration or RSC files, the path can be extracted and the filename
of the configuration file assembled correspondingly.
</p>
<p>If slb_init terminates by reason of a bus error, for instance,
then the caller will get <a href="gemdos_errors.html#EXCPT">EXCPT</a> as the result of the <a href="gemdos_system.html#Slbopen">Slbopen</a> call. In
order to intercept an unplanned termination of the library, the kernel
installs an <a href="bios_sysvars.html#etv_term">etv_term</a> handler for the library before calling
slb_init/exit.
</p>
<p><u>slb_open/slb_close</u>
</p>
<p>These are called at the opening or closing of the library
respectively. Once the library has been opened, the order is:
</p>
<pre>  slb_init()
  slb_open()
  slb_close()
  slb_exit()
</pre>
<p>Unlike slb_init/slb_exit, slb_open/slb_close run in the context
of the caller and in user-mode, with the user-stack of the caller,
even if the <a href="gemdos_system.html#Slbopen">Slbopen</a> call was performed in supervisor-mode.
</p>
<p>The library can also allocate memory at slb_open, though this
belongs to the caller and should be released again at slb_close. In
order to permit allocation of this reserved memory to the caller, the
library is also passed the current process descriptor at slb_open,
slb_close and at every function call.
</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> Due to a bug in 5.20, the passing of the PD
to slb_open and slb_close only works from MagiC 6 onwards.
</p>
<p>The kernel ensures that the open/close calls are nested
correctly, i.e. a process can not open a library more than once.
</p>
<p>The kernel ensures that the open/close calls are nested
correctly, i.e. a process cannot open a library more than once.
</p>
<p><u>Functions</u>
</p>
<p>Functions are not obligatory, so a library can hook in system
calls also via the AES or DOS that are removed again at
termination, yet generally functions are made available.
</p>
<p>A function is called with the following parameters on the stack:
</p>
<table class="UDO_env_xlist">
<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top"><a href="gemdos_structures.html#PD">PD</a> *pd</td>
<td valign="top"> Process descriptor of the caller, corresponds to the associated
slb_open()/close()
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">LONG fn</td>
<td valign="top"> Function number. Practical when several functions are
amalgamated (identical function pointers in LIBHEAD)
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">WORD nargs</td>
<td valign="top"> Number of the following arguments, in WORDs. If a function has
a variable number of parameters, one can ascertain the actual number.
Very useful for extensions, without having to incorporate new
functions. <b>Example:</b> If a function always expects a pointer,
but optionally also a WORD, it will receive either 2 or 3 as
<i>nargs.</i>
</td></tr>

<tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">...</td>
<td valign="top"> The remaining parameters

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The functions are executed in the context of the caller and with
its stack. As this call is generally made in user-mode, multitasking
will not be interrupted even for longer operations. Depending on the
function, the function result can be a LONG, a WORD, void etc.
</p>
<p>A function may alter registers d0-d2 and a0-a1, all other
registers have to be saved if appropriate. In particular, register a2
must not be altered, so that Pure-C routines may be called.
